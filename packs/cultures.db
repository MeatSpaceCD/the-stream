The Anabaptists opened their arms and welcomed their lost brothers and sisters. With warmth and love they were anointed with Elysian oils - and thrown into purgatory.</p>\n<p>Partitioned by a mountain range, Purgare is divided into two distinct regions. In the east, olive groves, wine vineyards, and bountiful crops. Ancestral holds are lined up like pearls on a string, each speaking of family tradition and honor. The west, however, has been burnt and poisoned by the vapors of the Reaper’s Blow. The ground quivers as rivers of lava roll relentlessly toward the Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>Amidst this destruction are the Psychokinetics. The Anabaptists know them by many names: Scum of the Demiurge, the Prime Evil, Devourers of Paradise. Fleas and mosquitoes buzz around them, clouds of gossamer burst from ravines and rocky clefts - each strand as hard and sharp as glass. In the Rifts, pure elemental darkness condenses and forms crystalline structures. The air itself compresses to force fields that fracture sunlight itself into a thousand broken strands.</p>\n<p>The Anabaptists say that Humankind must prove its worth right here and now, and march into the final battle. The Anabaptists are the chosen ones, and they will gladly follow Cathedral City into a holy war for the sake of mankind.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;vertical-align:top;border-style:hidden;width:40%\">\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ATTRIBUTES &amp; SKILLS</h3>\n<p>⏵CHARISMA<br />⏵PSYCHE</p>\n<p>⏵(CHA) Conduct<br />⏵(INT) Legends<br />⏵(PSY) Faith/Willpower<br />⏵(PSY) Domination<br />⏵(INS) Taming</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h3>COMMON CULTS</h3>\n<p>⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.yhUpQJSvEgeYpFhE]{Anabaptists}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.AsWh6KiJcS3jJc4T]{Apocalyptics}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.5lnvvHjSKXiFED9K]{Clanners}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.1NzqX2ndmuGL0b9q]{Hellvetics}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.71CrZLvw2P8NTqSR]{Scrappers}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.UiEuqxswx00k4Xwe]{Spitalians}</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>ARCHETYPE</h3>\n<img src=\"modules/the-stream/images/icon_archetype_purgare.webp\" alt width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"VqarDor7GXjDFwUX","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/header_culture_purgare.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"HISTORY","type":"text","_id":"XzyEn0sHNbOntfJw","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>ELYSIUM</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;height:688px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:688px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top;height:688px\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top;height:688px\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every year at harvest time, they take the long journey through the fields. Their striped yellow pants are soon gray from the dust, their oiled hair mats under the dirt. With sickles and shovels on their shoulders, the Anabaptists are led by one carrying a castiron sigil – the Anabaptists’ broken cross. Every step speaks of vigor, and in their eyes burns a fire eager to set whole regions aflame in times of war.</p>\n<p>Pine trees threw shadows across their path. They passed an altar with the Good Lady’s image, inclined their heads, and fell silent as was appropriate. Finally, they reached the Catalanos’ estate. Maids with buckets came running. Hospitality demanded they give a ladle of water to each of them, but like in past years, the strangers declined. Instead, they asked for permission to enter. But the gates remained closed to them. They talked to the foreman, offered help in tilling the field, but he only repeated the patriarch’s “No!”</p>\n<p>For seventy years, Abbondia Catalano refused the Anabaptists his house and land. The Gonfalone, the family’s war banner, was devoid of the Cult’s iconography: no broken crosses, no aqueducts. 300 years of tradition, stitched into blue velvet with silver thread, passed from father to son, brought to light every year on the anniversary of the Sala Riunioni and carried through the city’s alleys. Abbondia Catalano had grown old doing so. The gout had made his joints swell, and he dimly looked into the patio’s blinding light. His word still carried weight, even if his voice’s dark baritone had faded.</p>\n<p>Every year, the Anabaptists banged at the gate in that summer. Like the Gonfalone, it was a tradition. But this time his sons urged him to listen to the woman. They talked about the long journey from Cathedral City she had undertaken for his sake and that she was bringing him Heaven. He smiled. Calling one of these long-haired monkeys a “woman” was impolite, but fitting. He told them as much, but they only said: “No, no, this is not what we mean, padre,” and praised the Emissary’s beauty and her gift. Their sweaty faces were in view. Sweet breath engulfed him. He pushed them away and thought hard. The days had grown tedious, and this stranger promised relief.</p>\n<p>He shook his head. No!</p>\n<p>His family should walk through the centuries untainted by the Anabaptists’ folly.</p>\n<p>He smelled her before he saw her: a mix of lilac and olives, strong and strange. His sons stood at her side. Three rhombi on a perfect forehead, skin like mare’s milk. She moved closer and offered him nothing but to soothe his pain. He referred her to the good olive oil that he rubbed into his skin every morning and felt like a stubborn old ass. She nodded, gave him a green vial, and stroked his white hair. Warmth permeated him. He touched his head, felt the oil, wanted to scold her for her insolence when the heat burnt through his body and kindled a furnace within his chest. He straightened and exhaled. Age fled him. Sweat collected on his face in oily droplets. For the first time in more than a decade, his vision cleared: how his sons had grown!</p>\n<p>Although the pact has not yet been sealed, the Catalanos bowed to the Anabaptists that day. Where vigor and a doctrine of salvation could not tear down the barriers, the Elysian oils from Cathedral City’s mills paved the way. They rejuvenated, chased pain and fear away, broadened the perspective – and engrossed. Those who have had the oils permeate them once, had felt the breaking of all barriers, could not refrain from reusing them.</p>\n<p>One family after the other opens up to the Anabaptists. The old Gonfaloni are taken down, threads are pulled from ancient symbols to re-embroider them with broken crosses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>PURGATORY</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not 50 miles east of the Mount Vesuvius, an asteroid hit the rocky ground, crushed through into a magma bubble and detonated with a flash as bright as a hundred suns. The shockwave spread in a circular pattern, tearing up the landmass, crushing it and dropping it again when it had passed. Lava flowed from the cracks, magma chambers exploded into rows of volcanoes. For days, pyroclastic fallout rained down and obliterated all life that was left.</p>\n<p>Off the west coast, the Reaper’s Blow cut through the Mediterranean, emitting vapors and liquid basalt. This geological anomaly has never calmed. Poisonous vapors have been wafting across the land since that day, taking away the sunlight and all life. The Mediterranean’s foul algae slicks languidly and gurgles against the coast, forming a giant’s black, wrinkled skin on the beach. Within days, it will have dissolved into oily bitumen that turns the formerly white, sandy beaches into a stinking tar desert. The air is corrosive, the water poisoned. If birds stray here, they fall from the sky dead. Here and there, old kiosks and toppled wicker beach chairs jut from the bubbly black, and ruined hotel complexes look sadly to the poisoned sea.</p>\n<p>As if all of that were not bad enough, silhouettes are outlined against the volcanoes’ blaze. Around them, reality bloats and splinters into shards that fracture the light into gaudy kaleidoscopes. Stones float in the air and jut out in strange angles across the seas of debris, anchored in space and time. Darkness grows from Rifts in crystalline efflorescences as shimmering Filaments swell in vaporous clouds as hard as stone and sharp as glass. Those who stray there first notice the fleas and mosquitoes. In thick clouds they attack, crawling into clothes and biting. Shadows fall from the walls, condensing to shapeless cocoons, expanding, and tearing open. This is the end. Invisible deadly tripwires made of intertwined forcefields stretch between rocks as they flee.</p>\n<p>The Spitalians say there is an explanation for everything, referring to the Psychokinetics and their phenomea. They say a lot of additional research is necessary to understand the mechanisms of action, as even those Aberrants will too give up their secrets on the dissection table in the end.</p>\n<p>The Purgans only laugh at the doctor’s bigotry. For them, there is only one fundamental truth. The age of reason ended with the Psychokinetics, and the age of wonders – both good and evil – has begun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>SIGNS AND WONERS</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Is it still superstition when one’s own family is entangled in an unseen web of razor-sharp strands, their fingers and arms raining down like deadfall?

Purgan villages thus have an Augur who searches the sky for flocks of birds with glazed eyes. Crows in front of storm clouds are considered an unwanted sign, just like a crane’s cry in the morning. On the other hand, seagulls flying east, especially if they are numerous, are reason to rejoice, for they promise a safe return of warriors. People poke through the innards of sacrificial animals and calculate the best time for seeding from constellations. Holy men and women crouch in the cracks of the Reaper’s Blow for weeks. Intoxicated by the vapors, they think they are in the divine Pneuma, babble, scream and rake their bodies with their nails – but still they are revered, and their words are rewarded with food and ammunition. In the settlements, the rhythmic crack of whips announces the Flayers. The natives scrape the blood spraying from their backs with every blow from the walls and carefully scratch it off the loamy soil.

They were the bile in the Garden of Eden.</p>\nQuarrels led to fights. When the first head was split, there was no holding back. The Adriatic ran red. A massacre between farmers from the Balkhan and Purgare in 2201 sealed the region’s future. The Balkhani were driven across the river, but they stood their ground and destroyed the enemy farmers’ army. On both sides of the Adriatic, defense positions and watchtowers were erected. The war began. For 300 years, the fortified camps defied the incendiary projectiles. Their wooden beams are blackened and hard as stone, the tin roofs worn out from hails of rock. Boats and rafts lie broken in the reed, swords gather rust in the mud at the banks. Moldy boots and belt buckles tell of desperate attacks and rearguard battles. Bombings with burning oil barrels have incinerated swathes into the fertile land.<br /><br />On the Purgan side, a forest of broken crosses towers over the battlements. The Balkhani counter with ram skulls on pikes and flags showing a stylized ram’s head, a reference to the legendary Aries who helped the Balkhani in their hour of need and taught the Purgans pain.<br /><br />Yet for the first time since the beginning of the conflict, the catapults are quiet. The hatred cultivated over the years has lost its momentum.

Buggies encircled them, hunted those who tried to escape. The Neolibyan Sarahali, a big man with hands like paws and a tendency for flamboyant gestures, confronted the island’s eldest, put an arm around his shoulders and walked through the village with him.</p>\nDuring their stroll, Sarahali praised the Purgan women for their beauty, their glossy hair, and their broad hips. He praised the fields’ fertility and the farmers’ efforts. He stroked his belly and laughed. This island was so rich and loaded with corn, it had to be Purgare’s belly. He embraced the old man who had yet to say a word and who looked up at him with rheumy eyes now. That was polite enough. To be sure, there was only one thing he had wanted to proclaim. From now on, the Sicilian Purgans would work in the Lion’s shadow, and if he, Sarahali, this island’s Consul, should deem it necessary, they would also breast-feed the Lion.<br /><br />As the Neolibyan’s Purgish was bad, he used a word from an old dialect of the language to say “belly”: Bedain. Amongst the Africans, the island was soon called Bedain. The Purgans were not to call it Sicily anymore either. Those who dared to do so anyway were whipped.<br /><br />Sarahali loved Bedain’s wine, but he did not give a damn about his conquest’s agricultural wealth.

The sky appears like a wet watercolor painting: colors smearing into one another, spots of brightness bursting amidst brown dullness and melting together as black and red fight for dominance. Ember clouds surge through blackened cities and flicker as fiery paths into the night. Invisible carbon monoxide eruptions drift through the streets, enter houses, pour into shafts. The air shimmers from the oppressive heat, and the ground bakes under the burning sun.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>The Apennines form a natural barrier where poisonous vapors are stopped and condense against the rocks. The mountain range runs from the north to the south and bisects Purgare. On the east side of the Apennines the world is complicated, but it is still a human’s world. Beyond the mountain range, everything is different. The Apennines are a border in name only. Anyone can cross them. Many have done so due to their fragile honor or out of fear of Anabaptist indoctrination. Yet doing so has changed their lives, and for most there is no hope of going back.</p>\n<p>Those that do pass through to the other side settle in one of the hundreds of villages nestled on the Apennines’ slopes. Toxic swathes pass high above them as if following invisible field lines. The sun has a threefold halo and shines on placid towns with small streets and tiled roofs, olive groves and vineyards. Sometimes, it doubles for a second, and the distant mountains tremble as if there was a shivering membrane between them and the onlooker.</p>\n<p>The wavering sky heralds the presence of a Psychokinetic, hiding in a Rift nearby, wrapped in Filaments. He extends lines of force into fields that absorb all light, sealing entire villages in orbs of absolute darkness. Even more force fields protect his new domain and divert the poisonous fumes. Inside, the Psychokinetic begins harvesting his prisoners, populating the space with fleas, covering every surface with ticks, and flooding the villages with mosquitoes. The Plague bleeds the inhabitants dry, feeding its master.</p>\n<p>Despite the perilous nature of the land, there are those who willingly choose to try and make a living in this near-lifeless slag desert. The Romani rule in their ruined capital, trading with the few Neolibyans who still arrive to plunder the last dregs of Purgare’s history even as the poisonous gases of the Reaper’s Blow erode their palaces. Formerly white walls are pockmarked and black. Even the few intact windows are encrusted with a patina of dirt and soot. The people instead live in the catacombs, creeping through the tunnels. They have thrown out the bones and made themselves a new home.</p>\n<p>Scrappers rarely come to this nightmarish realm, unless they are truly desperate or truly gifted. The remnants of the Bygones have been coated under meters of thick volcanic rock and dust, and any expedition faces near-insurmountable obstacles in the form of the brutal environment and the threat of wandering Psychokinetics. However, those who do make it in Western Purgare make it big - artifacts lay almost perfectly preserved deep beneath the surface, held in the clutches of human figures encased in ash. The Scrappers don’t care about desecrating the bodies as they snap off fingers and limbs to get at the glimmering treasures they see past them.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Apocalyptic Flocks dart between Rifts, tossing children into the pitch black expanse inside to weave between the razor sharp Filaments and harvest Burn from spore fields. Most of the Finches never make it back out, sliced to pieces on the invisible death traps, but anyone bigger or more obvious would immediately attract the attention of the Psychokinetic lurking within. The Flocks roam the desolate wasteland, scraping together barely enough to survive, armed to the teeth and ruthless in their defense of what little they have.</p>\n<p>Even in this hell, humans can make it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>SYRACRUSE</h2>\n<p>SCRAPPER'S PARADISE</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Olive groves and vineyards, healthy crops in abundance, a mild climate, and friendly people – this is how Sicily greeted the Africans. They answered with a barrage of incendiary grenades fired from their ships, igniting the port, and sending in hundreds of Scourgers as a second wave. Five Surge Tanks crashed into the docks, their tracks pulverising the ancient concrete. They rolled through the fields and stopped in front of settlements, trembling and roaring. Buggies encircled the villages, and put the inhabitants under lockdown. The Neolibyan Sarahali, a big man with hands like paws and a tendency to flamboyant gestures, called for the island’s eldest, put an arm around his shoulders and walked through one of the villages with him.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>During their stroll, Sarahali praised the Purgan women for their beauty, their glossy hair, and their broad hips. He praised the fields’ fertility and the farmers’ efforts. He stroked his belly and laughed. This island was so rich and loaded with corn, it had to be Purgare’s breadbasket. He embraced the old man who had yet to say a word and who now looked up at him with rheumy eyes. That was enough politeness. To ensure the elder understood him thoroughly, there was only one thing left he had to proclaim. From now on, the Sicilian Purgans would work in the Lion’s shadow, and if he, Sarahali, this island’s new Consul, should deem it necessary, they would also breast-feed the Lion and take care that its belly was always filled.</p>\n<p>As Sarahali's Purgan was terrible, he accidentally used a word from an old dialect of the language to say ‘belly’: Bedain. Amongst the Africans, the island was soon called Bedain. The Purgans were not to call it Sicily anymore either. Those who dared to do so anyway were whipped.</p>\n<p>Sarahali loved Bedain’s wine, but he did not give a damn about his conquest’s agricultural wealth. What mattered to him was the proximity to the Purgan mainland and to the Balkhan. Over the decades, he made the city of Syracuse the starting point for Neolibyan looting tours in the Mediterranean. In good times, a hundred ships are anchored in the port, waiting to unload their cargo: scrap. Once cleared, swarms of Scrappers attack the heaps of technology, disassembling, repairing and sorting. Then anything useful is loaded back onto the ships to be sold on Tripol’s markets.</p>\n<p>What’s left behind are mounds of iron plates and broken machinery surrounded by a nest of cables and rust – a Mecca for Scrappers. The placid Mediterranean city of Syracuse has become a rusty technodrome, the historical city center smoldering under thumb-thick steel sheets, riffle files, and metal beams. Hulking cranes with magnetic grippers do their noisy work where people once strolled through enchanted alleyways and sparks fly from grinders where vineyards used to grow and prosper. The magic is lost. Today, cold, hard reality fills the streets with their artifact traders and workshops.</p>\n<p>Under the guidance of Sarahali, Syracuse has become the world’s largest wrecking port – for ships as well as for human driftwood. Its magnetism attracts every Scrapper, luring him into the labyrinth of monolithic wrecks and colossal junkyards. Old African Scrappers build rifles and apprentice anyone who slides a fistful of Dinars across the workbench. Clockworks showcasing the course of the stars, ship cannons, gearboxes weighing several tons, even delicate music boxes – if something can be constructed, there is a workshop in the city that makes it. In machine hangars the size of the Cluster, thousands of people live in the rafters while Surge Tanks are repaired and maintained in the decks below. Scrappers looking for kindred spirits can find lots and lots of them here. This is the heart of the Scrapper world, and it beats to the rhythm of the Neolibyan announcement drums.</p>\n<p>Syracuse births legends and heroes, and anyone fancying themselves a real Scrapper has to walk the city’s alleys once in his lifetime and leave their rune on a surf-washed iron wall at the southern cliffs. If there is but one custom the entire Cult adhere's to, it is this one, however irrational it may seem. But the glyphs serve a purpose. They are names, and they can be memorized. If a Scrapper leaves Syracuse behind one day, and lurches onward to a new location, he might run into a rune he had previously seen scratched into the iron wall, knowing that there is another one of his kind close by, one that can be trusted.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>THE MEDITERRANEAN</h2>\n<p>THE DYING SEA</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">On the coasts near the Rhône delta, the air smells of salt. The soft blue waves are home to thousands upon thousands of specimens of sea flora and fauna which provide nourishment to animals and people. The sea is rich with oxygen and minerals. Further south, the biodiversity ends. The surface of the water near the cities is covered in oil layers that shimmer in the sun. Thick carpets of algae that have been cut into abstract patterns by the boats and freighters passing through bob up and down on a foul-smelling swill. Below them, giant jellyfish swarms roam the depths to catch, kill, and dissolve the last schools of fish with their nematocysts. On the southern coast, there is no marine life left, not even a jellyfish. In the border regions between Franka, Purgare, and Corpse, the subterranean lava streams of the Reaper’s Blow boil the seawater – this area is extremely dangerous for ships of all size. Without warning, giant gas bubbles rise from the seabed drawing in boats and then creating towering sea waves which crash down upon them. Even deadlier are the small bubbles. Once the sea starts seething, the sailors don gas masks or press wet cloths to their mouths and noses. The caustic chlorine gas from the small bubbles burns the skin. If it enters the lungs, another ghost ship will wash ashore somewhere on the coast of southeastern Franka — if it doesn’t shatter against the rocks first.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>For Tripol, the Mediterranean is the golden gate to Europe. Day by day, freighters, cargo catamarans, and speedboats carry goods and artifacts from Europe to the land of the Lion. The Mediterranean routes are a profitable business for the Neolibyans and serve as lifelines for the Bank of Commerce. The wealth of Africa mostly depends on successful trade missions and the well-organized movement of goods. This is why the Cult employs ingenious methods when it comes to protecting its routes. It knows that the Albatrosses and Buzzards will attack mercilessly at the first sight of a mistake. Still, it‘s not very profitable to supply every ship with large guard details and heavy arms when the same troops could be accompanying expeditions in Europe. This is why shell games have become a part of the daily life on the waves of the Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>It starts in the ports. Misinformation about freights and routes is spread deliberately to lure attackers into well-prepared ambushes. Bogus cargo is also often used. A freighter that’s only fit for the scrapheap is the trojan horse; it transports a few boxes of valuable goods to fool the enemy, but behind them, Petro and explosives fitted with a timer are hidden. Let the vultures get what they deserve. However, these games inevitably devour too many resources, just like the extremely cruel punitive expeditions. Breaking one’s own habits has stood the test of time and proven to be more efficient. Some of the large freighters do not make for Tripol at all – instead, representatives of the Bank of Commerce inspect, evaluate, and transport the goods using mysterious mobile steel islands to bring them to an undisclosed location. When the freighter returns to Franka carrying new goods, many smaller ships touch at new ports of destination that are not a part of the route at all. If one of them gets lost, four others reach their destination. In spite of the increasingly bold Leopard attacks on the coasts of Africa, the losses are bearable.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>CORPSE</h2>\n<p>THE PIRATE'S NEST</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The sea heaves and falls like a dying man’s chest. Gigantic bubbles, some the size of a freighter, disturb the water, painting it green for a few fleeting moments before bursting into clouds of steam, smoke and gas. Mariners can tell by the color what lies ahead: it warns them of maelstroms. Within minutes, they whirl up to the surface and form vortices that can grip and tear whole fleets apart, dragging them to a watery death in the roiling seas below. Exactly here lies the Reaper’s Blow, sitting two miles below in the depths, a giant scar that will never heal.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>The island of Corpse huddles against it. It is lost to pirates and outlaws. For as long as anyone remembers, they captured ships, hauling them to Corpse, tying them to the shore and abandoning them. Today, an impenetrable wall of rusty hulls forms a barrier along the south and east shores. Harpoon cannons and catapults are mounted to the superstructures. The fairway can be blocked by chains, denying entrance to anyone.</p>\n<p>Beyond the fairway, shoals and sunken hazards await. The west coast of the island is 90 steps high and marks the border with Purgare. It is not navigable – the currents close to the island inevitably smash larger ships against the cliffs. The Africans have tried often enough. Only small cutters can approach ports like Ajaccio if they know the way through the scrap wall protecting the entrance. On all other routes, hidden harpoons and security chains or petro bombs can turn the fairway into a blazing inferno and block the way.</p>\n<p>Scourgers in their nimble torpedo boats have to land in uncontrolled bays and climb the rock spires in order to reach the hinterland. Sometimes, they also swim for miles under cover of the night to reach an offshore sandbank. Then, the retaliatory strikes against the pirate nests on the island begin. The Prides are battle-hardened – however, to prevent themselves from being spotted, they usually only take out an Albatross or Buzzard. After clipping some of the birds’ feathers, the Scourgers prefer to retreat after their assassinations. This, however, has not always been the case. Ten years ago, several well-paid mercenary bands from Tripol massacred the Sun Flock, an extremely dangerous and defiant group of hardened Apocalyptics. Their leader, along with a handful of his faithful followers, escaped the bloodthirsty Scourgers at the eleventh hour. The Bank of Commerce was not amused. Since then, the attack squads specialize in assassinating the leaders of the Flocks.</p>\n<p>This extremely dangerous ongoing battle is necessary, for Corpse is a rock that obstructs commerce for the Africans, and it cannot simply be blown up. The pirates of the island massively disrupt the trade traffic with Roma. They become more and more insolent, in turn costing more and more Dinars. With the scrap walls to the south and east being impassable and the west coast being inaccessible due to the immediate proximity to the Reaper‘s Blow, the Africans can only resort to sending in ruthless Scourger squads. Kifo, who are known and despised for their ruthlessness, can regain some of their old honor through these suicidal visits to the shore. On Corpse, not even the ancient rules of the Chaga are valid anymore.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"2AHdBHZoQAuxweJM"}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ieM8w4BeXJnt9Tn1"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"degenesis","systemVersion":"0.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677622742761,"modifiedTime":1677787855983,"lastModifiedBy":"OZIjrVbQoLiHLTla"},"ownership":{"default":0,"2qExmpp74cIKPqQF":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"0BcpTQZPjz9cJsib"}

Every ship sunk by Mediterranean pirates, every battle in Hybrispania and the Balkhan, it all brings up old pain. The chains of the past rattle like dissonant wind chimes, echoing loudly in the ears of the Lion.</p>\n<p>Yet Africa is strong and flourishing. The Neolibyan merchant Cult has been feeding the coastal cities with European loot for centuries, boring wells, creating factories, and paving footpaths to glorious promenades. Legendary artisans carve ancestral steles and forge and engrave hunting guns. Water carriers even give out free drinks, courtesy of the Neolibyans.</p>\n<p>The markets smell of spices, fruit, and tea. Hosts of children sit and listen in amazement to old men showing their scars, every mark carrying its own tale. They talk about expeditions to the Crow’s land. About the Scourgers’ bravery in the battles for Cordoba against the savages. About the pale shadows who love their rifles more than their mothers and wives. A gentle breeze drifts in from the Mediterranean. Blue and red awnings flap back and forth, the coal on the hookahs glows and sends ashes up into the wind. Rain clouds roll across the sky. It’s in the air - soon, the rain will pelt down.</p>\n<p>It will fall on the jungle, too. Where once a sandy desert glowed in the sun, rivers now meander through the land, mangroves sinking their roots into the water as the jungle steams in the heat. But in this jungle, something strange is growing: plants with polygonal leaves, prickly and tangled like a nightmare, a kaleidoscope of colours twisting in the shadows of the trees.</p>\n<p>The Psychovores. One scratch and a human’s skin starts to blister, boils searing and turning black in seconds. The Psychovores have transformed the land and its peoples, completely replacing the old vegetation. Everyone around the Psychovores finds themselves abandoning their native language, relapsing into a primordial tongue that only those also close to the plants can understand. Under the influence of the Psychovores, all language barriers have fallen and Africa has united, but the diversity of their tribes and peoples has been diluted as well.</p>\n<p>Now the Lion, Africa’s unifying symbol, rules supreme. The Neolibyans are its heart, lending it strength. The Scourgers are its claws, killing its prey. And the Anubians are its soul, governing its fate.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;vertical-align:top;border-style:hidden;width:40%\">\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ATTRIBUTES &amp; SKILLS</h3>\n<p>⏵INTELLECT<br />⏵BODY</p>\n<p>⏵(BOD) Athletics<br />⏵(BOD) Brawl<br />⏵(CHA) Expression<br />⏵(INT) Medicine<br />⏵(PSY) Reaction</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h3>COMMON CULTS</h3>\n<p>⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.FPf7cjQk7Tyhl8KA]{Anubians}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.AsWh6KiJcS3jJc4T]{Apocalyptics}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.5lnvvHjSKXiFED9K]{Clanners}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.V5Dju1WcwYJUgRR5]{Neolibyans}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.aQ1a7fSUx5uJiSlD]{Scourgers}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.71CrZLvw2P8NTqSR]{Scrappers}</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>ARCHETYPE</h3>\n<img src=\"modules/the-stream/images/icon_archetype_africa.webp\" alt width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"VqarDor7GXjDFwUX","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/header_culture_africa.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"HISTORY","type":"text","_id":"XzyEn0sHNbOntfJw","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>MAJESTIC</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neolibyans walk the streets, a wave of fine fabrics, blue and green, embroidered with traditional patterns.

More than half of the population suddenly seemed to be carrying a Kalashnikov.

Countries were smashed. There was war in the streets. But there was no serum. Misinformation. Mass hysteria. Hope blew away, only to finally come back into focus on Europe as if through a burning lens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">A grotesque fleet of floating coffins, rafts, torn free bateau bridges, and overloaded cutters risked crossing the Mediterranean to demand a cure from Europe. Those who did not drown during the trek encountered a steel wall of fear and reluctance. European cruisers, frigates, torpedo boats, and destroyers formed a security cordon along the African coast and denied them passage. Corpses floated in the sea, and Europe sinned anew. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">HIVE ate through Africa unchecked, but some regions were spared. Many Libyans and Sudanese were immune, just like the Masai.

They discovered common traits in their languages, laughed about the same jokes now, and proudly spoke about their tribes’ history and rules. The Fulbe explained their codex, the Pulaaku, which is based on the three pillars of self-restraint, honesty and wisdom.

Leathery cusps grow on ferns, mosses form symmetric hexagonal patterns, carnivorous plants press their digestive calyxes into the ground or rise high, growing perfectly geometrical leaves, pentagons and octagons glinting unnaturally in the light. They are thorny and brittle like glass. Their fruits bulge and shimmer in the light, but they are fragile and their pulp makes unsettling noises between the teeth before their poison seeps into the oral mucus and triggers a painful death. <br /><br />One scratch of their thorns and blisters grow on the skin within seconds and blacken. The blisters burst while the necrotic crater keeps growing deep into the tissue until the bone crumbles and the arm breaks. Nothing can stop the decay. <br /><br />The only liberation from the pain is death. <br /><br />These strange plants replace the old vegetation, already spreading along the equator and gaining ground fast. They transform the land and the people. Everyone in proximity to the plants loses their language and begins talking in tongues, thrown back to a primordial language that still somehow retains coherency. Every phoneme triggers an emotion like a well-known melody on a marimba. Language becomes an instrument, communication an intuitive music. And then there are the whispers on the air not produced by heaving trees or scratching branches. They sound so familiar and calming, but also often demanding without any words coagulating to any sort of sense. Many villages believe them to be an echo of their ancestors. <br /><br />All language barriers are breaking down. Africa unites, but the multitude of cultures and tribes is diluted by the plants’ influence.<br /><br />The Neolibyans call them Psychovores, the Spirit Eaters. Unity is fine and dandy, but these bubble-shaped, quickly growing Psychovore fields overgrow the coastal roads and reach the sea. Deep black roots coil into the water, growing and hardening. Soon an island of alien vegetation grows out into the Mediterranean. Villages are devoured, the people displaced. There seems to be no place for humans in the Psychovores’ lifecycle. The Anubians beg to differ.

Water gurgles and boils, hot bubbles rise up and burst into clouds of steam. The giant heap of debris is constantly moving, moaning and rumbling; earthquakes make seemingly safe caverns cave in. Only a bilious green variant of algae feels at home here and covers nature’s forces like a foaming carpet.</span></p>\n<br />People avoid this place. But east of this tectonic spectacle, they settled down centuries ago and reclaimed the ancient ruined cities. <br /><br />Today, docks reach out into the sea like giant hands. On the cliffs, houses with sprawling balconies grow, their windows hiding in the shadows of colorful awnings. Cranes cower at the outriggers like skeletal birds. Children sit on the battlements of ancient fortresses, climbing the cast-iron cannons, waving to the ships or throwing stones at them. In open hangars, Surge Tanks sit and crackle in the heat under panels of cloth. They will soon rumble across concrete ramps and onto transports to the sound of cheering and shouting. <br /><br />One-masted ships with red, triangular sails rock in the port’s soft swell and receive hundreds of travelers. Next stop: Tripol. Ancient military gliders owned by the less successful Neolibyans push past them, their sails a dirty black, their planks vermiculated and tarred. In between, the Scourgers’ motorboats crackle, racing out into the Mediterranean. But giant transport ships with superstructures of gold, silver, mahogany, and flowing silk approach the port as well. The wake from their bow makes the smaller ships bob up and down in the waters nearby. The smoke of their diesel engines rests in the bay like a haze and crawls into the docks and lungs of hundreds of white slaves waiting to unload them. <br /><br />Behind two- and three-story buildings, the terraced tower buildings rise from the metropolis’ haze. Palms accompany the travelers on their way. From the promenade, there is a branching network of alleys, leading past workshops and sky-scraping buildings with widely jutting balconies and carved balustrades. <br /><br />In between, every now and then you find boulders adorned with serpentine lines and gnarled giant jungle trees carrying tribal carvings and the name of the ancestors inhabiting them. In plazas, Scourgers have jacked up battered or bullet-ridden buggies. Slaves work on the vehicles so they can soon roar through the jungle again at breakneck speed. <br /><br />From the market squares, you hear the constant din of the masses. Upon paved streets an army of millions have stomped smooth grooves into the sandstone. The bazaars resemble a maze of stalls and walled shops. Here, you can find pharmacies offering dried starfish, ground Biokinetics spurs and Anubian wonder drugs next to vials of scented oils and paper-wrapped incense. Merchants unfold fabrics, caress jagged designs and praise the fine, knot-free texture. In other shops, lamps of colorful glass shine, some shaped like gourds, the next stall offers chased golden crockery, star-shaped incense burners hang next to bird cages from the rafters, side-by-side with baskets of jewelry and shoes adorned with glass beads. In an auxiliary hall, caretakers of rich Neolibyans wait for the next batch of slaves, preferably domesticated and educated. <br /><br />The coastal cities are the Neolibyans’ pride and joy. Here, they showcase their wealth and prove their generosity. Here, the Dinars’ golden streams converge together and flow into their pockets.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>TUNIS</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">In Bygone times, the United African Organization (UAO), the counterpart to the European UEO, was located in Tunis.

From here, the Neolibyans set out into the Mediterranean, exploring the coasts, building gaudy counting houses and starting fresh business relationships. Through goods from exotic places like Franka or the Balkhan, through the salvaged machinery and weapons, the flood of Dinars grows and pours into the city’s streets. People follow it, dragging along their millennia-old cultural achievements.</p>\n<p>The masses live in skyscrapers flagged with awnings and panels of cloth. Ancestral statues made of black hardwood lean next to their doors, wind-bells chime in the breeze. Next to them huddle one-story lodges with broad terraces, their walls whitewashed or covered in bamboo. Strands of cables link the houses, forming a network above the plazas that cuts the sky into triangles. Surge Tanks tower like rocks in the sea of people, and in less than two days, ladders are in place and carpets adorn the upper deck. Old men sit in the shadows of the arcades and smoke cinnamon flavored tobacco. Young people congregate on the rooftops, dangling their legs while someone offers them tea. Others stomp and clap to the rhythm of their own songs, forming circles, leaning forward and parting again, singing out their joy.</p>\n<p>Ancient buildings rise everywhere in Tripol, some with battlements, resembling fortresses and standing proud, others cowering in quiet alleys. None of these buildings remain empty for long. The tribes are proud of their origin and show the treasures of their cultural heritage wherever they can: mahogany figurines gather dust next to fur-covered shields, knives with curved blades, spears, clothing, and jewelry. Supposedly, there are ancestral statues carved out of Psychovore wood in one of these museums, the Clan responsible for them having merged with the Anubians decades ago.</p>\n<p>The Bank of Commerce’s huge, gilded dome can be seen from the port. No place is more sacred to the Neolibyans than this temple to the Dinar. Here, merchants acquire trading permits once a year, granting them the right to trade along certain routes or profit from specific high value areas, such as plantations and oil fields. Here, the Anubians assess the Thread of Life of any Neolibyans entering into long-term contracts, and the slightest disturbance can mean a premature death or a restless life – both reasons not to make the deal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>THE BANK OF COMMERCE</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Travelers reach this historic city and thus the Bank of Commerce’s realm through a great circular, arced gate.

The Shabath Clan hunts these creatures. Especially Bengasi’s hinterland promises rich bounty. For months, the Shabath journey through the Discordant Psychovores and watch the bulbils. If the hunt was successful, they tour the coastal cities with their findings and exhibit the creatures in glass boxes. A creature that resembled a group of squids with the respective creatures’ tentacles joined to form a net was considered last years’ greatest find. The creature clung to its containers’ glass and continually formed geometric patterns with its tentacles while the heads exhaled blue fog.

Never before had the Crow been allowed to fly free in the Lion’s country. The Scourgers of all people found a solution.

The Spitalians did not like the idea of being buried alive, then clawing their way back to the surface and chewing on intoxicating leaves for days. But they had enough sense to play along. From this moment on, they were considered honorary Africans. Today, they are a curio, and people come to Qabis from faraway to marvel at the white Africans.</p>\n<p>Wakili gave two old Surge Tanks to the doctors. On both, the Spitalian cross consisting of large red beams is clearly visible on the scratched sides. One is called Aesculapius and serves as their headquarters. The four floors contain a sick bay, several labs, a reefer, and a library. Since they moved in, it has not moved at all: the engine is only started from time to time to recharge the batteries. Wakili called the second Surge Tank Ndulu – which means “brother” – as a gesture of goodwill.</p>\n<p>Months ago, hosts of slaves carried provisions and gasoline into the Ndulu. African Scrappers looked over the chain links, started their arc welders, repaired and replaced parts. With sledgehammers, they removed huge patches of rust and repaired the weakened hull with metal plates. Test runs for the two gas turbines made the Ndulu roar, tremble, and spit out hot smoke. The patches rattled, some shook loose and fell to the ground. The African workers threw their hands up in despair, but then laughed. At least, the tank had not completely collapsed!</p>\n<p>Over a month ago, the Ndulu and its crew of Spitalians started its journey into the heart of the Psychovores. Like a primeval beast, it burst through the brittle plants and crushed them under its tracks. The fruit burst into glittering clouds. The Surge Tank became entangled in vines and several miles of shrubbery, but the screaming gas turbines forced it through every obstacle in its path.</p>\n<p>Driving straight south, the Dhoruba was easy to find. African scouts from the Masai tribe followed the Ndulu in its swath and watched as it suddenly turned to the east, towards Anubia. Maybe even towards Cairo.

Slaves dig sewers and lay down flagstones on beaten paths.</p>\n<br />In Africa, wealth always follows the family tree’s branches. Yet sometimes, those branches break and even the trunk may wither. New scions sprout, but their roots draw water, not gold. Such villages are nestled into forgotten bays or amidst the jungle, far off the network of roads. Their inhabitants fish in lakes, hunt antelopes or monkeys. They weave their own fabrics from plant fibers. At their hips, they carry bone knives, and they paint their naked torsos with tribal symbols using holy earth. They watch the metropolis with skepticism and curse the Scourgers’ stinking, noisy buggies.<br /><br />Still, they know no envy. They thank their ancestors for the goats that give them enough milk and the sun that rises every morning and bathes them in warmth. But while the ancestors are listening, could they maybe make the Oka people with its motor ghanjah full of dried meat arrive before the Neolibyans get here today? They may know no envy, but that does not mean that they don’t resent being poor. Dozens of Clans have formed a loose union. Together, they work against the Neolibyan trade monopoly. They don’t care for concessions and land wherever they please. They never felt represented by the most powerful of the African Lions. At most, they were the dust between its claws.<br /><br />Thus, they call themselves Leopards and point out with a grin that a Leopard is far quicker and more cunning than the irritable Lion. They race through the jungle on secret paths and fly across the Mediterranean on maneuverable ghanjahs, always one step ahead of the merchant Cult. They kill their prey and eat quickly, leaving only a chewed cadaver in their wake.<br /><br />The Neolibyans avoid the Atlantic. Gelatinous bubbles the size of a Surge Tank crash against the ships’ hulls, arching over the ships’ side and gumming up with other bubbles to form a stringy carpet from which there is no escape. The Leopards’ sailing ships, however, cruise through the water unmolested, at least as long as they stick to the coast. Maybe the vibrations of the Neolibyan ships’ engines are responsible for the gelatinous glut.<br /><br />The Leopards start from Tangier, navigate around Hybrispania, follow Franka’s coast, and enter the Vulture’s domain. A dangerous move if you look at the Aquitainian ship graveyard of countless wrecks torn apart by highcaliber rounds. Considering the current, they all must have come from where the Leopards are headed. But so far, all ghanjahs have returned, loaded with crates full of books, golden jewelry, and golden teeth.<br /><br />The Leopards’ reputation grows. They decline Neolibyan trade goods, only relying on goods from Leopard villages. The tribes thrive without drowning in pomp.<br /><br />To the merchant Cult, the Bank of Commerce’s word is the law. Concessions are everything. Without them there would be anarchy, the Neolibyans say, and those Leopards... well, they attack established routes with their unruly trade. So they need to go.<br /><br />But even the Scourgers hesitate. As guardians of traditions, they do not want to shoot fellow Africans. But if they don’t, someone in Bedain will.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>LIFELINES</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The triangle consisting of the Ahaggar, Air, and Tibesti massifs is considered the heart of the north and source of Africa’s lush vegetation.

The jungle is no less merciless than the Scourgers.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>STEEL</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The jungle seems endless. Under its canopy of intertwined tree crowns, there is eternal twilight, and fallen trees and quagmires make quick traveling impossible. No one claims to really know the jungle.</p>\n<p>In its depths, the Africans encounter concrete walls and ancient fortresses. Trees grow upon them and reach into barracks and flooded cellars with their roots that are thick as arms. Sometimes, these buildings are not deserted. Stooped, humanoid creatures stand in the twilight, lichen hanging from their shoulders, wetness glittering on blue steel. For centuries they stand motionless, until something rouses them and their anger. They screech, and the fingernail-sized sensor arrays jerk left and right, focusing. They jump forward, tear roots from and out of their body, wipe away the moss. They crackle and rattle as their heads turn. They capture their surroundings with ultrasound while their eyes complete the picture. They patrol old facilities and sink deeper into the wet ground with every step. Their every movement perfect and to the point, the servo motors of these silent predators whirring amid the sounds of the jungle.</p>\n<p>These AMSUMOs – called “Machine Men” – are a relic of the white Bygones. They once served as a means of oppression, the legend says, until something happened to them and they freed themselves from the white man’s mental grip. That did not help, though, for from then on they were loose cannons.</p>\n<p>Those who meet them in the African jungle these days may be lucky and encounter a machine that has scratched a 2 to the power of 16 into its own forehead. Presumably, these AMSUMOs have a soul, having watched humans or animals and learned from them through imitation. Maybe they’ll never again leave their humans finder’s side, copying his habits and speech patterns. However, it’s also possible that they’ll see him as prey whenever they’ve finished studying leaf-cutting ants. Machine Men are almost always dangerous, and always deadly if they are provoked.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t keep Scrappers and Scourgers from hunting them. The AMSUMO leg tubes and carapaces are light and almost indestructible – the perfect add-on to a Neolibyan’s splendid clothing. Each of those pieces tells a story, and the blood of dozens of people clings to each and every one. The merchants will pay more than their weight in Dinars for even the smallest piece.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"STORIES","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>A BOX OF SOULS</h2>\n<p>KIZMETH'S TRIAL</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was chaos on deck. Kizmeth counted twenty Scourgers. All of them beefy oxen, clad in armor and animal hides. They smelled of war, blood, and depravity. Like a pride of starving lions they inspected the cargo fastened to the hull of the barge, cracking sealed barrels and rummaging through baskets in search for food and supplies. Such random searches were common these days. The Scourgers were hunting for pirates, Guerrerros, or any other riff raff on their kill list.</p>\n<p>“Who’s your merchant?” The Damu with the crimson mask had stepped close to Kizmeth, positioning himself against the glaring sun shining above the Mediterranean. Kizmeth had to squint to keep him in focus. “Magnate Ashkari, of Qabis”</p>\n<p>“Since when does Ashkari ship to Gibraltar? New route? Got any papers for the cargo?” The Scourger unlatched his mask and revealed his face. Scars, split lips, and a grin of broken teeth greeted her. There was a sly look in his eyes, and Kizmeth understood that there was no fooling around this time. If they found out what she had hidden under deck, they’d skin her alive and throw her remains into the open sea.</p>\n<p>“Yes” Kizmeth rummaged through the deep pockets of her leather skirt and produced a wrinkled parchment. With trembling hands she unfolded the paper, revealing stamps of the Bank of Commerce and signatures from the loading docks in Qabis.</p>\n<p>“Why so nervous, girl? You’ve got nothing to hide, right?” he sneered. Kizmeth clenched her jaw, forcing herself to stay calm. “Just reverent. I don’t get to speak to Lions every day” she replied hastily, trying to smother the Damu with a compliment. The Scourger gave her a fiendish smile, and drew a dagger from his vest. The polished steel flashed in the sun.</p>\n<p>“You’re way too pretty for a liar” he poked. “Why would someone with a frame like yours ship cargo into the warzone, instead of spreading her thighs for a Magnate back home?” The Damu leaned toward her and ran his blade carefully across Kizmeth’s cheek, scraping off beads of sweat with the knife’s edge. Kizmeth fought to remain still, even though fear crawled along her spine. She knew a single sign of weakness would incite the Scourger’s lust for blood.</p>\n<p>“Dakkar, step away from her!” The command came from the left. A Hondo in heavy battle gear climbed up from under deck, his face terrified as if he’d just run into a ghost. “The bitch has got an Anubian. He’s sanctified the barge. We must leave!”</p>\n<p>Behind the Hondo a young man crept from the hatch. A red cloak covered his shaved head and hung loose over his shoulders, and his exposed belly exhibited four white circles revolving around his navel. Dakkar billowed his cheeks in disbelief, looking over to the Anubian and back to Kizmeth, as if trying to grasp if he got tricked.</p>\n<p>“Freighter of the dead.” Kizmeth said, pouring all her courage into words. “We’re bringing wounded Scourgers back to Hybrispania, whose souls hang in the balance.” She looked over to the Anubian who stood there in silence, shielding his eyes against the blazing sun. “He’s our Hecatean.”</p>\n<p>“She speaks the truth. There are forty Imiut skins in the belly of the barge. Smells like a slaughterhouse down there.” the Hondo confirmed. “Let it go Dakkar, the bitch ain't worth the trouble.” he said, fidgeting with the ancestor token dangling from his neck.</p>\n<p>“Lucky day, desert flower.” Dakkar tapped Kizmeth’s thigh with the flat side of his blade, taunting her. “I’ll catch up with you in Gibraltar, when your witch doctor isn’t around.” He signed his threat with a smirk and licked his broken teeth. With a swift gesture he sheathed the blade and covered his face behind the crimson mask. Then he collected his pack for retreat.</p>\n<p>Kizmeth knew she had just escaped certain death. She watched on as the Scourgers rappelled down to their speed boats one by one. Ten heartbeats passed before she heard the engines roar and allowed herself a sigh of relief. She glanced over to the Anubian, who nodded in affirmation. The young man was chuckling to himself, as he wiped off the white paint from his belly. They were safe. As were the forty slaves, sewn into the Imiut skins belowdecks, whom they were smuggling back to their homeland. A freighter carrying fallen war heroes – what a daring hoax. Kizmeth had fooled the Lions with a Leopard’s cunning.</p>\n<p>Madame Dayo would be proud of her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>PSYCHOVORES</h2>\n<p>ALIEN FLORA</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>As asteroid fragments punched crater after crater into the soil of the northern hemisphere, a stray one ploughed through the sky above Africa. Over the Sudan, it entered the atmosphere with a blazing flash, tearing through the air at blinding speed before escaping back into space.</p>\n<p>But Africa wasn’t spared. The projectile cooked the surrounding air to more than 30,000° Celsius, painting a cadmium yellow trail across the sky. A blast wave thousands of times above normal atmospheric pressure struck the continent, a tsunami of air moving at Mach 10 tearing through the Earth and devouring humans, animals, vegetation, entire cities and even mountains. In its wake it left a scar gouged across Africa, over 300 miles wide: the Dhoruba.</p>\n<p>For hours it rained debris: trees, rocks, dirt, and concrete crashing down onto the devastated land. Yet, even amid this destruction, seeds, moss spores, and plant matter also drizzled back to Earth, along with particles torn away from the asteroid as it passed. Years later, the first signs of life reappeared. Forests nestled between boulders the size of houses. Vegetation had reclaimed the Dhoruba, but these trees, bushes, and ferns were of alien design.</p>\n<p>Today, something ancient blooms within the Dhoruba, something that is not from this world. Leathery cusps grow along ferns, mosses form symmetric hexagonal patterns, carnivorous plants press their digestive calyxes into the ground or rise high, unfolding perfectly geometrical leaves in the shapes of pentagons and octagons that glint unnaturally in the light. The offshoots are thorny and brittle like glass. Their fruits bulge and shimmer with otherworldly sheen. But as fragile as they seem their pulp makes unsettling noises between the teeth before its poison seeps into the oral mucus and enters the bloodstream.</p>\n<p>One scratch of their thorns causes blisters to grow and blacken on the skin within seconds. The blisters burst while the necrotic crater keeps burrowing deep into the tissue until the bone crumbles and the limb breaks. Nothing can stop the decay. The only liberation from the pain is death.</p>\n<p>These strange plants gradually replace the old vegetation, already spreading along the equator and claiming more territory by the day. They transform the land and its people. Everyone living in proximity to the plants loses their language and begins talking in tongues, thrown back to a primordial form of communication that still somehow retains its coherency. Every phoneme triggers an emotion like a well-known melody on a marimba. Language becomes an instrument, interaction resembles intuitive music. And then there are the strange whispers floating through the air and not produced by heaving trees or scratching branches. They sound so familiar and calming, but also often demanding without any words coagulating to any sort of sense. Many villages believe them to be an echo of their ancestors.</p>\n<p>In the process, all cultural barriers are breaking down. Africa is uniting, but the multitude of traditions and tribes is diluted by the plants’ influence. The Neolibyans call the alien sprout Psychovores, the Spirit Eaters. Unity is fine and dandy, but these bubble-shaped, quickly growing Psychovore fields overgrow the coastal roads and reach toward the sea. Deep black roots coil into the water, growing and hardening. Soon an island of alien vegetation grows out into the Mediterranean. Villages are devoured, the people displaced. There seems to be no place for humans in the Psychovores’ lifecycle. The Anubians beg to differ. Only they can enter this strange plant belt and come back out alive, returning with bags full of seeds.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"2AHdBHZoQAuxweJM"}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ieM8w4BeXJnt9Tn1"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"degenesis","systemVersion":"0.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677622742761,"modifiedTime":1677788919752,"lastModifiedBy":"OZIjrVbQoLiHLTla"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"OZIjrVbQoLiHLTla":3},"_id":"66m5SNklWKo9AhjO"}

Dusty shrubs poke from windows and birch trees grow in the slipstreams of buildings, drilling their roots deep into the soil, down into the labyrinth of forgotten tunnels and tubes.

Close to the settlements, all that remain are swamps and the forests that have eluded the axe are far off the normal routes between cities.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>JUSTITIAN</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Borca’s largest metropolis can be found at the heart of the scrap craze: Justitian, the Righteous Fist, the source of law and order in this wasteland and a truly charismatic place</span></p>\n<p>The city’s Providers mark their parcels of land with reed fences and fight back the dust. After the harvest, they face the Spitalians. If the grain is spore free, it is certified and the sacks are stamped and sealed. If the grain is infected, the Provider has lost a year of hard work.</p>\n<p>The Providers are milked everywhere. They buy fungicides from the Spitalians and water from filling stations that only flow as long as they insert the Chroniclers’ metal chips. But enough is enough. The Providers gang up, wail, discuss. One of them stands up and creates the Providers’ Collective. They still slave under Justitian’s yoke, but the fuse is already burning.</p>\n<p>In Justitian’s Downtown, everything converges. Anabaptists wait for the political upheavals in their Cross Quarter, throwing dirty looks at the neighbouring Jehammedan Quarter. Apocalyptics put out feelers in all directions and monopolize all forms of sin. Street kids have conquered the Stukov Quarter and divided it up between their gangs.</p>\n<p>The Chroniclers’ speakers tower above the town<br />houses, the shacks in the Guest Quarter, and the Jehammedans’ tile-adorned buildings. Boisterous music blares<br />from the speakers, only interrupted by announcements: “CITIZENS, THE CLUSTER SPEAKS!” The Judges patrol on battlements and bridges made of rusted plates, smoking weed and staring into the crowd below, exerting absolute control.</p>\n<p>Amidst a maze of corrugated iron sheets, gangways, walls made of coaches and machines, and tarpaulincovered dens, a truncated monolith has risen. Approaching this leviathan, its facade falls away, more mountain than ruin: Tech-Central. Thousands of Scrappers nest within like cockroaches, digging into it, expanding tunnels and reinforcing halls, shaping it. Here, those that like solitude unite. Dust coated Lone Wolves drag sacks full of artifacts, coughing ceaselessly, Cave Bears look for a bride, among humans for the first time for many winters, Mice scuttle around the Badgers, doing tricks to market their agility. The Manufacturers in Tech-Central are known far beyond Borca’s borders. From their workshops, they produce not only weapons or highly complex locks and traps, but legendary mechanical wonders, aimless constructs that are nothing more than a testimony to their creators’ mad genius.</p>\n<p>Another stone colossus seems to guard the Uptown plateau: the Steel Monolith. The Steel Masters’ hammer blows ring down, providing the city with a beat. The forge fires blaze. Here, gun barrels are made, stocks are carved, fittings are chiseled and refined by a “Fiat Lux”. Every Judge’s musket has passed through the Steel Masters’ hands.</p>\n<p>Uptown is home to the Judges and Chroniclers. It is situated on a plateau and can be reached only via an engine-driven elevator platform when you come from Downtown. In Uptown, the Judges’ legislative power is focused on official buildings and the Judiciary. Amidst the Judges monumental architecture, the Chroniclers’ Central Cluster is only a short walk away. The triangular solar panels, the railway wagons, the steel towers with megawatt lights and speaker batteries, the winding halls and domes: it all seems like a place from another time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>MILESTONES</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Stacked stones mark the routes between settlements.

No one, not even the Providers who tirelessly worked Justitian’s fields, were able to resist this collection of rules. The Spitalians searched grains and bulbs for Sepsis: only food which they certified was allowed to be sold in the market. Rules, rules over all. Those who were tired of them could just try their luck in the wasteland. Those who rebelled or broke the law ended up in labour camps where they were forced to work off their debt to Justitian. The Codex divided people into citizens and outlaws, but the Judges had overlooked the fact that if they kept tightening the corset of control day after day, they’d choke the breath of their people away.<br /><br />Still, Justitian flourished. Judges were sent to the surrounding towns, offering protection and demanding submission. The Protectorate was born.

One of the fleeing groups found water in the western Black Lung, fortified the well and stayed. The refugees licked their wounds. They lived in their wagons and were ready to move on. But the reservoir did not deplete. Thanks to a geological anomaly, the water pooled in the cellars and tunnels under the camp. They decided to stay.</p>\n<p>Decades later, the camp had developed into a city called Liqua. Four water lords controlled the sources and sold their water to Protectorate settlements and Cathedral City. The Anabaptists were not far away. They made pacts with the Liquans and their leaders. They signed contract after contract, infiltrated the line of succession, sat next to the lords, inspected all treaties with the Black Lung enclaves, and finally told the people that Cathedral City had taken Liqua into the fold. Since then, two of the water lords have always been Anabaptists.</p>\n<p>When Exalt was rediscovered, Liqua’s population paid heed. Dispatches and gifts were exchanged, and hands were shaken, all hidden from the Anabaptists’ watchful eyes. Cathedral City had no idea what was happening here.</p>\n<p>It was only when the Exalters marched into Liqua to the thundering cheers of the population that Cathedral City realized the calm days were past.

The friendly Protectors on the Stallion Streets diligently deal with any criminal problems, the Advocates lift up the Codex like a protective shield over the citizens of Justitian, defending the inherent wisdom of the book with razor-sharp wits, all while Supreme Judge Archot lays the foundation for this peaceful coexistence with his groundbreaking new laws. Hail to the glorious Justitian! Where else in the wasteland is every human being equal under the law, as an independent individual with basic fundamental rights?</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>Justitian is a sprawling wild growth composed of endless networks of streets, walls, and buildings that will drive any urban planner trying to make sense of it into despair. The city has expanded uncontrollably for two hundred years around its central nucleus: the Cluster. It was from here that the first buildings were erected, and from where it stands that the first roads poked through the original cottage settlement on the Uptown plateau. The city has grown to such size that is cannot be discussed as a single entity: anyone who refers to Justitian must define what part of the huge metropolis he is talking about. Justitian’s footprint extends far beyond the city limits, and includes the entire surrounding countryside, along with its population.</p>\n<p>The Rubble is by far the largest region of the city, but also the most sparsely populated. In this ring of fat around the metropolis the city’s Providers mark their parcels of land with reed fences and fight back the dust. After the harvest, they face the Spitalians. If the grain is spore free, it is certified and the sacks are stamped and sealed. If the grain is infected, the Provider has lost a year of hard work. The Providers are milked everywhere. They buy fungicides from the Spitalians and water from filling stations that only flow as long as they insert the Chroniclers’ metal chips. But enough is enough. The Providers gang up, wail, discuss. One of them stands up and creates the Providers’ Collective. They still slave under Justitian’s yoke, but the fuse is already burning.</p>\n<p>Downtown is the colossal foundation of Justitian, and the collecting pool for the masses flooding into the metropolis seeking business or entertainment. Apocalyptics put out feelers in all directions and monopolize all forms of sin. Street kids have conquered the Stukov Quarter and divided it up between their gangs. The Chroniclers’ speakers tower above the town houses, the shacks in the Guest Quarter, and the Jehammedans’ tile-adorned buildings. Boisterous music blares from the speakers, only interrupted by announcements: “CITIZENS, THE CLUSTER SPEAKS!” The Judges patrol on battlements and bridges made of rusted plates, smoking weed and staring into the crowd below, exerting absolute control.</p>\n<p>Amidst a maze of corrugated iron sheets, gangways, walls made of coaches and machines, and tarpaulin covered dens, a truncated monolith has risen to tower over Downtown. Approaching this leviathan, its facade falls away, more mountain than ruin: Tech-Central. Thousands of Scrappers nest within like cockroaches, digging into it, expanding tunnels and reinforcing halls, shaping it. Here, those that like solitude unite. Dust coated Lone Wolves drag sacks full of artifacts, coughing ceaselessly, Cave Bears look for a bride, among humans for the first time for many winters, Mice scuttle around the Badgers, doing tricks to market their agility. The Manufacturers in Tech-Central are known far beyond Borca’s borders. From their workshops, they produce not only weapons or highly complex locks and traps, but legendary mechanical wonders, aimless constructs that are nothing more than a testimony to their creators’ mad genius.</p>\n<p>Uptown is home to the Judges and Chroniclers, and is the nerve center of all power in the city. It is situated on a plateau and can be reached only via an engine-driven elevator platform when you come from Downtown. In Uptown, the Judges’ legislative power is focused on official buildings and the Judiciary. Amidst the Judges monumental architecture, the Chroniclers’ Central Cluster is only a short walk away.

This includes the territories of the Clans and uncharted domains, as well as unsettled provinces. Some arrogant Advocates in Uptown go so far as to call everything a Wasteland if it lies outside of the grasp of Justitian’s influence, including other Cultures, the Mediterranean sea, and the African continent. But such trash talk is useless when it comes to narrowing down unexplored territory, and there’s plenty of it south of Siege. These regions haven’t seen pacification since the days of the City Wars and there lie the unexploited remains of the Bygone era, caked in soot and debris, eroded by time and left untouched since the Eshaton. In this great expanse, Scrappers search for the only thing of value left in the world: artifacts.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>Today the Clans nest in this malicious environment and use the ruined landscape as their refuge. To venture into these desolate areas is a dangerous undertaking, as death lurks around every corner in many forms. From starving Gendo packs and raiding Cockroach cohorts to glistening image walls that transmit hypnotic messages, the Wastelands are a deadly trap for anyone entering unprepared.</p>\n<p>Firsthand reports come from hellbent Scrappers who dare to traverse this treacherous terrain. Other intelligence is collected by Preservists who pierced through the fog of war to get a glimpse of the other side. All accumulated information leads back to the same conclusion: these areas are hostile to life. The landscape is jagged and cracked, well-trodden trails end nowhere, burnt hills block the view, and totem poles of the Clans rise like ghostly warning signs.</p>\n<p>They hail from a different age, the Era of the Beast, when the whole world was consumed by their thirst for blood. They lived here long before humanity ascended from the dust to reclaim its legacy. They were powerful in a time when the Cults were nothing more than fractured groups of frightened survivors, penned up behind the walls of Bygone fortresses. The Clans were here when the warlords of Exalt assembled their forces to purify the land and ravaged the soil from which the Protectorate feeds today. The Clans were always here.</p>\n<p>Their territories are the lands of their ancestors and forefathers. Generations of champions and chieftains are buried under the ashes from which the Protectorate rose - warriors of a lost and forgotten age, heroes of the Apocalypse, and warmongers of the Eshaton. Their monuments were pulverized in the City Wars, and their tribes were scattered by the conquest of the Judges, driven away from their burial mounds and holy sites by the cracking thunder of lead and black powder. They watched from afar as others tilled their fields and desecrated their temples, splitting ancient stone circles to rebuild fortifications and cities from the debris. They struggled, driven to the edges of the known world, devoid of a homeland. They bred, and with every new child that sprung forth from their unity, they rekindled their hatred.</p>\n<p>The Black Lung was once their home. If one digs deep enough, they will find skeletonized residue, mass graves, and the tombs of chieftains. In 500 years, this soil was plowed through, razed, and lined with corpses. The bones have formed calcium deposits underneath the red layer of dust. Children of the Protectorate sometimes dig up ancient skulls, baked in iron oxide, and play football with the cranium of some former chieftain who murdered his way to glory half an eternity ago.</p>\n<p>North, south, east and west - the direction doesn’t matter, the dilemmas remain the same. Enemies lurk everywhere. The Protectorate is encircled on all sides, and the safe ways out can now be counted on one hand. The only secure trade route to Hellvetica leads via Bassham towards Mulhouse, and from there to the Alpine Fortress. The Northern Passage, once connecting the Protectorate to Briton, has collapsed.</p>\n<p>Reports of Clan raids have become daily routine, garrisons are wiped out, stables are looted and set ablaze in the Rubble. Within four short years the Protectorate's frontiers have turned into a death zone. Those who set off there risk their lives.</p>\n<p>The Judges respond with violence. It is their strongest weapon, but even they know that the outcome of this conflict will be decided by numbers alone, and those are on the side of the Clans. For decades they have bred and multiplied until they reached terminal size. Their territories are no longer large enough to supply them. They are pushing forward.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>A235</h2>\n<p>CHAGALL'S NEST</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Raven Chagall is a man with many faces – shrewd negotiator, master strategist, charismatic daredevil, and pain in the ass. Nobody questions that he’s the undisputed ruler of A235, an outlaw settlement planted on the trade route between Cathedral City and Justitian. There are many reasons for that.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>For one, his domain is virtually impregnable, sitting on a colossal ruined bridge that leads across a dry river valley. The massive concrete pillars supporting it rise over a hundred meters high to hold up the remains of an ancient Bygone highway that serves as the foundation for the outpost erected on top. Two hydraulic drawbridges connect the main structure with the surrounding hillside. When they’re pulled up, there is practically no way to enter the encampment.</p>\n<p>Laying siege on the city from the ground is just as futile. The mighty pylons have withstood not only the Eshaton but the following 500 years of weathering and erosion. The artillery shelling required to significantly damage the structure would be immense. Meanwhile, the valley offers no protection to conquerors, instead turning them into sitting ducks who can be killed easily by a hail of rocks hauled at them from above, the immense height turning even the smallest pebble into a murderous projectile.</p>\n<p>But Chagall’s reputation is owed to more than just the fact that A235 is an impossible nut to crack. The Raven himself bears the title of personal Juryman of the Supreme Judge Archot, a prominent position he received in exchange for joining the Protectorate. This was previously unheard of – an Apocalyptic rising to the top of the food chain, bolstered by the support of Judgement Hall? Many Advocates shook their heads in disbelief when the news broke. Of course, Archot had his reasons. He was irritated by Chagall, but understood that the prospect of attacking the settlement would be far more wasteful than simply showering the Raven with gifts and letting him bask in newfound importance. What the Supreme Judge failed to anticipate: Chagall could never be satisfied. His ambitions were boundless, on par with those of the man sitting in the highest office, therefore loyalty toward the Judiciary was nothing but a temporary state of mind. As long as the Raven was able to milk fat customs payments from traders using the stretch of fortified road network leading through his domain, he was tame. But this wouldn’t last forever; that much was clear.</p>\n<p>When the Enemoi refugees showed up at Chagall’s doorstep begging for asylum, the Raven didn’t hesitate before having the drawbridges lowered to allow the Orion to roll into his miniature kingdom. He knew full well how much this gesture would sting the Chroniclers, and it took less than a day for him to be declared public enemy number one, with Shutters swarming out in all directions to find a weak spot in A235’s defenses and eliminate the Raven who crossed the line. Chagall can’t help but laugh at their petty attempts. He’s the one holding the reins and has already begun negotiating with the Anabaptists for protection. Are the Chroniclers really foolish enough to try and oust an established ruler this close to the territory of their nemesis? Good luck! Better watch out for those bidenhanders, they cut through rubber just as easily as meat and bone.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>THE ICE BARRIER</h2>\n<p>AT THE LIMIT</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This is the limit. A colossal ice shield inches forward, devouring a few meters more each year. Its glacier tongues are hundreds of meters tall and carve their way through the countryside, crushing everything that gets caught underneath. The entire north of Bygone Europe has already fallen victim to its endless hunger. Secrets and artifacts which have been buried forever by the Ice Barrier are the framework for the wildest and most hair-raising legends.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>This is a hostile place. The wind burrows incessantly into the ears, gnaws at the bones, freezes the fingertips, and jolts the senses. On days when the sun glares from the sky, the endless white flashes so brightly that it creates black blotches on the retina. Without protective goggles one goes blind within a few hours. Nobody ventures here voluntarily. Only punitive workers condemned to hard labor by the Judges have to cut glacier ice in this frozen hell. Via Sinder, the northernmost town of the Protectorate, the ice is transported back to the cold stores in Justitian to conserve food or to provide refreshment during Borca’s brief but vicious summers.</p>\n<p>As if the prisoners along with their overseers didn’t already have their hands full fighting off stray Stukov Nomads who add just another threat to the extraction of glacial ice, mammoths were suddenly sighted this year. The Garganti appear to have surmounted the Reaper’s Blow and reached Borca by traversing the ice sheet from the far east of Pollen.</p>\n<p>What do the mammoth riders want? To fraternize with the barbaric Clans from the south? Are they also targeting Justitian? Will the whole world rise up against the Protectorate until its last resistance is broken?</p>\n<p>Sinder is preparing for a frontal onslaught by the Garganti. Ragnulf, the City Judge in charge of this remote settlement, has ordered the population to dig trenches around the city filled with spikes and explosive niter barrels. All watchtowers are to be manned day and night. He’s written an urgent letter asking for support from Judgement Hall, but his call for help has yet to yield any response. Archot seems to be focused on the southern border beyond Siege, where Cockroaches and Phosphorites are drawing their armies together.</p>\n<p>Nobody can navigate the Ice Barrier. Common sense forbids the thought. But the corridor used by the mammoth nomads is unknown to the people of the Protectorate. The Marauder Gusev, however, knows it perfectly well, as he has repeatedly wandered across the vast ice sheet throughout the last decades.</p>\n<p>Setting off in Noret his journey takes him to distant Danzig, where he has become known as the Icebreaker, each of his surprise visits listed and locked in the files of the field hospital. Time and again the mysterious stranger, clad in rags and bandages, crossed the eternal glaciers leaving electronic markers in his wake that serve as a path guiding back to the fringes of the Protectorate.</p>\n<p>For a long time, this corridor remained a mystery, only available to this lonesome wanderer whose motivations are an enigma, even to the Spitalians in the far east. But now, the electronic markers have begun firing an impulse that interferes with a sound frequency that can only be perceived by mammoths. Something buried deep within their genetic code commands them to travel the ice sheet toward the Black Lung. The Garganti herding these animals are stunned, as the beasts don’t respond to any of their riders' attempts at steering them back to Pollen. Instead they stomp forward like calves following the call of an invisible mother.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>STUKOV DESERT</h2>\n<p>NOMAD TERRITORY</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>An infinite plain of salt flats stretches across the north of Borca, from the Janus Crater in the west to the roaring canyons of the Reaper’s Blow in the east, separating the Black Lung from the chilling breeze of the Ice Barrier.</p>\n<p>The Stukov Desert is a nightmare of its own. The air is so dry that breathing alone is a difficult undertaking. The ruthless wind sweeping the cold down from the foothills of the glaciers never ebbs, instead it billows dust particles into red clouds, blowing them through the air until the entire sky turns into a smear of rust reducing visibility to just a few meters. Keeping orientation in such a dust storm without a compass or other technological means is nigh impossible. Worse yet, the dust cakes everything, covering tracks, landmarks, ruins, extinguishing campfires, clogging filters, and jamming complex electronics. Any Chronicler’s Source module exposed to such conditions would go haywire within seconds.</p>\n<p>Legends told in every tavern in Tech-Central has it that entire cities lie sunken underneath the carpet of salt and dust. Occasionally rooftops of submerged skyscrapers become visible, in other places the bows of gigantic freighters rise from the ground like ghosts of a long forgotten past. These sightings spread like wildfire among Scrappers, who suit up immediately to inspect the validity of a suspected cache. But getting deep into the territory is anything but an easy job for the dirt diggers. They have to face the reclusive natives of the area, and they don’t like unannounced visitors. The Stukov Nomads appear out of nowhere, camouflaged in the crimson colors of the surrounding landscape; barely detectable to the eye. First they fire a warning arrow, the tip made from the stinger of a Stukov Scorpion and coated in fierce venom. If the Scrappers don’t respond with retreat, the Nomads will be back a second time, turning the single shot into a hail of vengeful arrows or setting deadly traps for the Scrappers hidden beneath the sand.</p>\n<p>During summer, when the sun is strong enough, the Ice Barrier thaws and sheds water. Small streams meander across the salty flatlands before they are soaked up entirely by the ground. In some depressions however, the waters accumulate into tiny pools and ponds for a few weeks. If Scrappers make it to such an oasis trying to replenish their supplies, they have to do so with utmost care, as the Stukov Nomads poison these watering holes with Dust Worm larvae; a final parting gift for the unwanted visitors.</p>\n<p>Who was the First Wanderer that brought the Stukov Nomads to this barren land? Barely anyone truly cares. The Black Lung is filled with myths that have spiraled so far into the realm of the unimaginable that they’re hardly digestible. If one follows the logic of the Chroniclers, the answer is rather simple. During the first years of the conquest of the Black Lung, the wounds were still fresh. Judges drove the native tribes before them with reckless abandon, trying to crush even the slightest defiance with a barrage of lead.</p>\n<p>In this time one tribe supposedly fled into the desert to survive the purge. Were they led there by an enigmatic figure? Did they hide there on purpose? Do they carry faint knowledge that needs to be wrestled from them? Who knows.</p>\n<p>What the Chroniclers do know is that the Stukov Nomads are a nuisance, and that they sit on top of formidable treasures buried beneath the salt. They pay extra for every reckless hunting party ready to march into the dunes and eliminate a few of these primitives, thus clearing the turf for proper excavations.</p>\n<p>The Cluster has intel of at least three active RG caches which still hold Sleepers of unknown Cascades. These deep-frozen soldiers are a far bigger threat to Justitian’s safety than the spear-wielding barbarians of this salty domain. The Chroniclers must destroy the Dispensers before they eject their Project Tannhäuser cargo, yet they’re facing a double bind as they cannot make this knowledge public. If the Palers caught wind of these hidden bunkers, the whole operation would turn into a race against time of who gets there first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>THE REAPER'S BLOW</h2>\n<p>ONE BODY SPLIT IN TWO</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Everything is in motion.

The earth trembles, rock shelves break away with a crash, tilt, splinter and push on top of each other. Magma gushes over the edges and casts a reddish glow onto the devastation. The soil that once bore golden grain is hard as coal and just as infertile. Puddles of slag boil and emit yellow plumes of smoke. Without breathing protection, lungs will blacken and wheeze. Humans and animals alike are burnt and crushed to soot.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>Nothing can survive here anymore.</p>\n<p>This is the Reaper’s Blow. It’s a tectonic phenomenon starting high in Borca’s icy north, then cutting through the Alps in a southward arc to reach Africa’s coasts at the bottom of the Mediterranean. Along this line, the ground is torn asunder, giant sheets of rock the size of cities form a scar many hundreds of kilometers long. Rivers were torn from their beds, fell down across the edges to reappear as geysers elsewhere. Magma chambers bloat right beneath the surface and discharge into volcanoes.</p>\n<p>In Borca, there is a well known exclusion zone around the tectonic nightmare: stay 20 kilometers away, or risk your life. Closer than that distance and the fumes seep into the lungs, every breath leads to a burning chest pain, and continued exposure to the vapors will result in rashes and blisters breaking out all over the skin. The Judges do not patrol here, out of fear for their own safety - after all, who would be foolish or hardy enough to live in this nightmare? But the Judges are blind to the true nature of the area. Swarming in subterranean caves warmed through the crushingly cold Borcan winter by the Reaper’s Blow, the Cockroaches have been breeding and expanding their numbers, waiting for the right moment to strike. Their time is now.</p>\n<p>To the south, off the west coast of Purgare, the Reaper’s Blow cuts through the Mediterranean, emitting vapors and liquid basalt. This geological anomaly has never calmed. Poisonous gas clouds have been wafting across the land since the day Eshaton tore the land asunder, choking the sunlight and all life along the way. The Mediterranean’s foul algae slicks languidly and gurgles against the coast, washing ashore like the charred and wrinkled skin of a decomposing giant. Within days, it will have dissolved into oily bitumen that has turned the formerly white, sandy beaches into a stinking tar desert. The air is corrosive, the water poisoned. If birds stray here, they fall from the sky dead. Here and there, old kiosks and toppled wicker beach chairs still jut from the bubbly black carpet, and ruined hotel complexes look sadly out to the poisoned sea.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"2AHdBHZoQAuxweJM"}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ieM8w4BeXJnt9Tn1"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"degenesis","systemVersion":"0.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677622742761,"modifiedTime":1677780892158,"lastModifiedBy":"OZIjrVbQoLiHLTla"},"ownership":{"default":0,"2qExmpp74cIKPqQF":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"DSdkF6rOf3lVN18Z"}

The Frankans were familiar with fishing boats and the rafts they poled through the swamp, but these were fortresses made of iron, their sides higher than Souffrance’s termitariums.

Slabs of rock the size of small villages break away and slide thunderously into the depths, breaking along the rings, crushing vents and all life that flourishes between them. Stone is laid bare, and now everyone sees that finger-thick insect paths riddle the spongy surface. Termites surge out of the wall, clumps of mud in their mandibles. Only a few days later, the wound is scabbed over, and new vents have grown.<br /><br />Waves of people mixed with shimmering chitin buttons press through the canyons of mud buildings. Huts cuddle with the vents, encircling them up into heady heights. Some have crumbled and been deserted, dusty grass mats flying in the wind. Others are dark with wet building materials, from their roof openings, trails of smoke rise.<br /><br />On plazas, high above head height, stone monuments tower into the air. They are covered with hollows that resemble honeycombs. In the recesses, amber-colored drops glisten – the Pheromancers’ stringy glandular discharge. Humans and insects follow the same pheromone trail from monument to monument.<br /><br />No one lives in Souffrance for long. For those who have given into the Pheromancers, the months on these slopes are a spiritual experience that makes them one with the peacemakers. Most leave as emissaries, finally going out to carry the Pheromancers’ wisdom to the surrounding villages.<br /><br />The Pheromancers mark their property with pheromone markers, enabling their emissaries to safely climb the crater wall and pass the insect barriers unchecked. Once they reach the crest, they worm into the cusps where the Pheromancer Queens breed.<br /><br />Visitors to Souffrance see this as an honor.

The bombs tear holes as high as a house into the swarms of wasps, yellow-black insects raining down to the ground. But the swarm is still strong.

Insects poured down the steps, catching their fall with trembling little wings, streaming over the Ziggurath to pour into ditches in the bottom.

If someone stops and steps towards the wall, the colors melt into their spectral components and form a masked face: the Oracle. It names the approximate locations and descriptions of ancient artifacts that could be exchanged for Drafts at the nearest Chronicler Cluster. Then, the plate’s pixels die away.</p>\n<p>The path reaches Toulon. The Chroniclers once planned to make it their new scrap trading hub on the south coast of Franka, however it was left listless with little trade at all when they pulled out of the region. For years the city languished in the hands of the Touloni, unable to prosper, until the eyes of a cunning Neolibyan found their way onto their stretch of land. The Raider, Hamza Abubakar III, sailed in on his ship, the “Unya,” tossing gifts over the side to the people of the city. He had his eye on the concession, and after 7 days of negotiation with the Touloni he was the new ruler.</p>\n<p>At first it was prosperous and the Bank of Commerce were looking forward to their investment paying off, before the Pheromancer Murnakir began to threaten the Scrapper expeditions. All seemed lost, until in 2589 Hamza was somehow able to negotiate a peace treaty with Murnakir, establishing a border which neither party would cross. Since then, the city has become a booming hub for the scrap trade on the south coast, with the Chroniclers looking enviously from across the border in Borca.</p>\n<p>From Toulon, the trade line runs west and crosses the Rhône delta to Montpellier. Here, the Neolibyans’ transport ships have been landing for decades, unloading Africa’s treasures. The market is colorful and noisy, a scent of herbs and exotic spices. In a Neolibyan Surge Tank, the Africans exhibit stuffed lions, elephants, antelopes and the corpse of one of the mysterious Machine Men. Spitalians patrol the city walls. Through binoculars, they watch the towering vents in the distance and gauge them. Yes, they are coming closer.</p>\n<p>Onwards to Toulouse, cultural center of free Franka. Books recovered from Parasite are freed of mud and mold and restored to their former glory. This ancient knowledge supplies the people with an identity beyond the battles that touch the soul. Nevertheless, the Pheromancer threat is felt in Toulouse, too.

They weed out roots, carry away rocks and dig ditches. Those who collapse from exhaustion are dragged to the cathedral in Saint-André in handcarts by singing children.

As proof of his story, he brought back wondrous artifacts and palm-sized, finely chiseled claws from all of his journeys.</p>\n<p>The maps he drew, the claws, and some of the technological masterworks are stored in the chambers of the Chroniclers’ Central Cluster in Justitian today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>BRITAIN</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">In the north the rim of the Janus Crater forms a border between the European continent and old Britain.

Holy Land. Briton is invincible. This piece of land at the end of the world has written history. It has defied the machinations of the Demiurge. With a single stroke of his sword, the Sublime Vicarent slew the Pheromancer King Ganaress and delivered a whole people from the curse of Franka. This is the legend that has spun the yarn of Briton’s invincibility for twelve years now. A fabled final battle, into which numerous other tales have been woven, leaving no one able to decipher what really happened on the 11th of October in the year of 2585.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>Autumn is returning to the country, and thus, the holiday in honor of the Sublime. The Anabaptists pay homage to their hero Vicarent, for he has achieved by his own power what no one else was able to before him. He is the Chosen One, the conqueror of the Demiurge. Heroic epithets and exploits widely attributed to his greatness alone fill entire books now. His mind is stronger than the power of the Pheromancers; pure Pneuma flows through his body. Under his watch, Briton shall remain invincible. While many reach such heights only after their mortal demise, he has already become a legendary figure within his lifetime. Everywhere he sets foot, people bow in awe.</p>\n<p>For years, however, there have been rumors of an alleged Starfire, considered the most holy of Anabaptist relics. The Starfire supposedly helped Vicarent attain his victory and the Spitalians are anxious to get to the core of these rumors. Borderpost North has been destroyed and the Cult of Doctors has lost one of its main bridgeheads in Franka to swarms of parasites. Where two years ago, the North Passage linked Briton to Borca, one finds today a marshy death zone, making it impassable.</p>\n<p>If a miracle like the Starfire actually exists, the Anabaptists must reveal it. Bargaining is not an option for Vicarent. He challenges the Spitalians of Rennes, threatening them openly and warning them not to mix themselves in the affairs of the Anabaptists. If the snooping should however continue, he is more than willing to dismantle the brotherhood of arms. After all, it was his Cult that freed the land from the Pheromancers and wiped out the Demiurge. Anyone who is not a member of the Broken Cross has no right to come into close proximity of the Starfire. Even the knowledge of the relic’s location is not known outside the circles of the Anabaptists.</p>\n<p>This alone is reason enough for the Spitalians to become suspicious. They dispatch a secret elite unit of the Red Pack to explore Briton. Preservists. Kranzler’s people. The local Epigeneticist Dr. Vega is the brain of this clandestine operation, which bears the code name “Mission Concorde”. Their objective is to reveal the mystery of the Starfire. If need be, with brute force. But the Spitalians are about to lose sight of their objective at hand. An oily substance has washed ashore causing previously undocumented mutations. The doctors are convinced that there is only one conclusion to be drawn: The sixth Chakra is about to bloom. As these events unfold, another danger is spreading in the slipstream of Mission Concorde. Brest, Briton’s capital, has become a haven for something powerful, and it attracts the attention of two Marauders.</p>\n<p>Argyre and Aries.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>RHONE SWAMPS</h2>\n<p>MURNAKIR'S REALM</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Famulancers and Recruits are on their way south down the Rhône for the first time. They crouch at the railing, trying to protect themselves with their gas masks against the all-encompassing, putrid smell. Suddenly, the monotonous chugging of the Petro engine stops. The captain of the swamp cutter raises his finger to his lips, calling for silence. He lets the boat float. The Famulancers and Recruits gaze feverishly from the helmsman to the riverbank and back. Nervous tension fills the air. The first nerve cords threaten to fray. Suddenly, a throaty chortling breaks the silence as the captain shakes with laughter. He explains to them that the swarm isn’t one to nest on the water. No one needs be afraid as long as they stay on board. Death lurks on the shores and in the depths of the impassable thicket beyond. The engine starts rattling again. They keep moving south.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>Without the region’s eponymous river, there would be no north-south passage. The Rhône is the main route for any form of travel in this region – be it the Spitalians’ troop movements and supply convoys, the Apocalyptics’ Burn smuggling, or the commonplace movement of goods between Southern Franka and Borca. At the same time, the Rhône and its countless tributaries inundate the surrounding countryside. Without the river, the swamp characterizing Southern Franka and covering several tens of thousands of square kilometers would not exist. It is the breeding ground of the Pheromancers.</p>\n<p>The first extensions of the swamps make themselves known through soft smacking sounds; footprints are suddenly covered in water. Swarms of flies rise and form dark clouds above small puddles that soon turn into ponds and larger bodies of water. Forsaken villages in this region bear testimony to the battles fought to the death by native Clans in this clime. Everything is silent except for an occasional gurgle. Further inland, the sodden meadows turn to boggy seas of reed, which are interspersed with clusters of trees. They are the harbingers of the swamp woods stretching from the Rhône along the tributaries of the main river. In this impassable thicket of vegetation, the water runs slowly, giving off an air of stagnation. This, however, is not the case. Claggy chunks of Sepsis waft patiently through the twilight under a canopy of leaves, looking for dry land to conquer. Wherever they land, thousands of ants swarm out to carry the seeds to their destination. They share this realm with termites and swarms of wasps whose nests extend over three to four treetops at a time. The mounds of this plague are often several meters high; they are the unmistakable sign of spore field being close by (the exact proximity of which cannot be determined in this impassable terrain). In general, there are almost no landmarks perceivable to the human eye – after an hour in the swamp, everything begins to look the same.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>TOULON</h2>\n<p>PEARL OF THE SOUTH</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Toulon is steeped in the spirit of the Neolibyans.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>It has profited from the influence of Africa like almost no other city in the land of the Crow. It has become a symbol for success under the auspices of trade, its importance along with the number of inhabitants grows quickly. It has become the center of the goods trade extending from Borca across the Alps. For the Hellvetics of Territorial Region I, the city is a welcome relief from the dull white of the mountains. For the Apocalyptics, it means protection, expansion of their business and smuggling routes. Its port guarantees profit for everyone involved; however, success generates envy and hate.</p>\n<p>For years now, Toulon has been a smudge on the lenses of the Chroniclers of Justitian and Aquitaine, and yet, the city bristles with potential. The possibility of a powerful union of city states with the two other coastal cities, Montpellier and Perpignan, should not be underestimated as this could seriously threaten the predominance of Justitian on the European continent. The Judges identify the largess and the lenient laws of the coastal cities as the problem. As far as the Senate is concerned, a detachment of City Judges and Protectors should be sent across the Alps to instill the Neolibyans with some order and responsibility. In their eyes, Toulon is a swamp breeding lawlessness, and it’s only a matter of time until the bandits it births come across the mountains and try to establish their habitual misconduct in the Protectorate. This cannot happen. There cannot be another power rivaling Justitian’s and questioning the authority of the laws of the Protectorate.</p>\n<p>For now, the Neolibyans are firmly established. Although they are masters of foresight, often planning several years ahead, they have become drunk on the success of the last decades and have lost their eye for detail. For a long time now, hidden powers have been at work in Toulon, eroding the city’s substance. They want to dissolve the rule of the Africans by driving them from the city to drown in the sea; they want to conquer their wealth. In the bowels of Toulon, a secret conspiracy thrives behind closed doors in Terres Putain and in the Scrapper districts of Ferrallies. It gains momentum, finds followers and co-conspirators. Soon, they will show their unsightly, envious faces and reach for the crown.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>BRITAIN</h2>\n<p>KINGDOM OF THE VULTURE</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The line between life and death, ascension and madness is neither fixed nor forgiving.

A land that gives birth to dreams and nightmares alike. A Marauder reigns supreme here, his authority irreproachable and uncontested. With an iron fist, he crushes every intruder. His word is law, spreading itself over thousands of square kilometers. How the tyrant keeps his cannibal tribes of Pictons in good spirits remains a mystery south of the border; how he manages to have his eyes and ears in every corner of his domain as well. The Chroniclers and Spitalians have long abandoned expeditions to Britain. Nobody tests the waters of the autocrat.</p>\n<p>Nobody except Scrappers. Why do they venture into this territory? Legends of riches fuel their imagination, adventurous tales of undiscovered caches and artifacts. Some are convinced a land of milk and honey lies beyond the Janus Crater, others a cornucopia of ideas, a hyperborea of unexpected possibilities. Some, however, are simply searching for a way out of their miserable earthly existence. Britain’s attraction is overwhelming. Who resides there? What secrets are buried beneath the frozen ground?</p>\n<p>Arrogance and pride drive some to take the dangerous step. When they surmount the core shadow of the Janus Crater, the sky collapses behind them. Their end is near. No one ever returns from the Land of the Vulture.</p>\n<p>Those few who make it across the crater’s hollow belly and climb the opposite side are confronted with a new reality. It's sinister up here in the North. No birdsong. No cricket chirps. An icy wind whips across the wasteland, bending crippled trees to the ground. It crawls through every hole left unpatched, gnawing mercilessly at the bones. The cold is infinite, as is the frost, which covers the ailing land like a blanket of white powder. Here and there, tawny patches of grass stubble sprout from the encrusted earth. The steel skeletons of a buried building appear atop a layer of permafrost. In the distance, an emaciated arctic fox pricks its ears, listening for prey. But the area has been laid barren. Here, there is nothing to eat.</p>\n<p>Argyre’s territory is deserted; a region that guards as many secrets as its self-declared ruler. In the last decades, countless Borcan Scrappers have disappeared beyond the border of the Janus Crater, their remains scattered for hundreds of miles across its northern edge. Thousands of human skulls dangle from wooden poles and iron posts, painted in a strange green light. In the darkness of night, they shine like phantasmal writings on the wall.</p>\n<p>Beyond the eerie humming of the Janus Crater, a battered wilderness rises: cliffs of rubble covered in snowdrifts and unwieldy fields of debris obstruct the way to London. The frames of charred cars and other Bygone means of transportation lie strewn along cracked asphalt roads. Collapsed bridge piers and tankers that have been hurled ashore rise up to the sky. Formidable obstacles. On occasion, terrible screams ring out over the ruins. Another reckless Scrapper has fallen prey to the Pictons.</p>\n<p>All of this is just a prelude until one reaches London. The burned city of the Bygones. Black towers baked in snow and ashes. Abandoned streets lead into the bowels of the city. Reindeer herds trot through deserted ruins of molten asphalt and granite. Polar bears skulk around behind house fronts with smashed windows, through roadblocks and in the refuge of dead ends. The animals have chosen the upperworld of London as their home. They are the silent inhabitants of this desolate wasteland.</p>\n<p>Out of nowhere, the ground begins to vibrate. The reindeer become startled. A stream of light glows from an underground crevice, accompanied by the screeching wails of a machine. The noise is unbearably loud. Suddenly, Maglev stations in the entire city come to life.</p>\n<p>Trains race along the Bygone magnetic rails, carrying their occupants far beyond the city limits. Pictons, Argyre’s slave warriors, are aboard the wagons. Like every night, they go out hunting for prey in order to appease their god. But they do not hunt animals. They hunt Sleepers. The Marauder is waiting for his Ambrosia.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"2AHdBHZoQAuxweJM"}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ieM8w4BeXJnt9Tn1"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"degenesis","systemVersion":"0.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677622742761,"modifiedTime":1677783719710,"lastModifiedBy":"OZIjrVbQoLiHLTla"},"ownership":{"default":0,"2qExmpp74cIKPqQF":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"HPl5BY1xF8esjTNR"}

Ribs fused to form a carapace that no Anabaptist could pierce with his bidenhander. Some remained in the spore fields and spun spider threads to register every movement. Others hatched the spider plague in skin folds and roamed around, spreading Sepsis. The most powerful of them grew up to become bony towers covered in thick flesh. The Chakra ether’s rhythm sent ripples through these colossi. Their arms and legs dug into the depths, down into the groundwater, even deeper into the continent’s heat. They were blind in this world, but all-seeing eyes in the ether. From their pores, spiders were born and protected the trembling flesh against wind and rain with a thick net. Waves of Psychonauts followed their Chakra calls.</p>\nThen, something happened. From Hybrispania to the deepest Balkhan, a jolt went through the Psychonauts. The Biokinetics screamed and thrashed, bleeding from their genitalia. Many burrowed into the ground, clutching glazed rock. Spurs broke, gnarled bulges sprouted from their whole bodies. The towers crumbled to the ground, moaning from meter-thick windpipes as their replete flesh withered and bone strands burst under their weight.<br /><br />The Spitalians later called this event the Discordance. The Psychonauts’ Chakra collective had encountered the Psychovores’ collective: shockwaves tore apart the links between the Chakras and abandoned the Psychonauts in the ether’s void. The first Biokinetics never found their way back. They degenerated and still haunt Pollen’s tundra as mindless Spore Beasts.<br /><br />A new generation of Biokinetics arose from the Clans and linked with the spore fields. It all started anew<br /><br />But something else had survived the Discordance. Buried deep within the ground, a bloated cusp of pure life energy slumbered. The thick skin tube supplying it with nutritious ichor collapsed months ago. Interwoven with human DNA, protein molecules latched onto the being’s genes and rewrote the program. Stem cells specialized into phagocytes or brain cells, only to revert to their generic form shortly after. Calcium and other minerals fused to form teeth and bone sails.

Once the sapling pierces the skin, it bloats and sprouts blossoms. At this point, the roots are already draining blood from the lungs, and the first strands are already engulfing the spine.<br /><br />Survival is impossible.<br /><br />The Clans know the dangers. If they offer a meal from roots, leaves, and sprouts on a piece of bark to a stranger, they ask him for his trust. If he declines, they respect his caution.

When they rise from the mists after hours or days, they tell of crushing masses of flesh, a fracturing of the mind, of entwinement and humid closeness. Some Clans even report a change in the Fractal Forest once you have eaten of its fruit. New trees grow, others wither as the fruit’s color changes.<br /><br />The forests treat the Clans well, and they do likewise. Clanners free the trees from spiders, tear webs, dig up Rift Centipedes and crush them. They protect the forests against Spitalians and Apocalyptics.<br /><br />However, sometimes a Fractal Forest demands more.<br /><br />The ground splits open and reveals the interior of a man-sized muscle sac made of white, fleshy strands. Contraction waves ripple along the interior wall, making openings flutter. Yellowish digestive fluid sloshes in the deep: a phagocyte cusp. The Clanners offer it rabbits and Gendos as well as blessed children, enemy warriors, or captured Spitalians. The cusp closes over the victim, the opening becomes a scar soon covered by grass once more.<br /><br />One day, the Fractal Forest’s life energy is spent. Trees splinter, the fruits rot, the grass dissolves into bristly fibers. The Clans thank the forest and move on. They do not notice how the countless phagocyte cusps they have fed throughout the seasons burst one by one. The rabbit jumps out unharmed and licks its belly as if nothing has happened.

From there, travelers go to Brno.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>SILK</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eastern Pollen’s Przadkas brave Pollen’s web-coated forests and ruined chasms.

Neolibyan Surge Tanks are parked along the fortress wall like dusty bunkers. Scourgers pull a Biokinetic’s body from the cargo hatch on ropes, Scribes in canary robes sweep the forecourt, putting up tables and chairs, while an African boy brings a tray with a silver jug. A shout can be heard from the city’s battlements. With a rumble, a Surge Tank awakes, black jets of exhaust hiss from a hatch bursting open at its side. The boy kneels, sets down the jug, grimaces and puts his hands to his ears. A turret turns, a cannon rises with a rattle, lowers again by a hand’s breadth. The barrel moves up and down, then pauses. Muzzle flash. The Surge Tank jolts, the cannon crashes into the turret, strikes the damping. The boy rises. Squinting, he stares into the distance. A flash blooms into a fireball, over five kilometers away. On the battlements, Wroclaw’s guards cheer, the Scourgers on the cargo hatch laugh and clap their hands. They probably won’t be able to recover this Biokinetic in one piece.</p>\n<p>The Neolibyans see Wroclaw as an attraction.<br />They come here to prove themselves as Great Hunters.<br />Pheromancers in Franka are good, Dushani in the Balkhan<br />are a challenge, but to slay a Biokinetic a marksman must<br />put the bullet right between their bone plates. Then he<br />reloads, fires round after round into the attacking beast<br />until it falls in a fountain of dirt. Target practice with the<br />Surge Tanks only serves to entertain the Scourgers for the<br />city’s benefit.</p>\n<p>Wroclaw profits from the Africans. Apocalyptics are hired as beaters, Scrappers offer scouting expeditions through Bygone ruins, Clans sell goat meat and vegetables to the strangers and satisfy their lust for the unusual. Sometimes with Burn, sometimes with young women or men.</p>\n<p>Above all this, the Piast sits enthroned, watching, waiting, leading. For centuries, he has been governing the city, distancing it from the Eshaton and making it stronger. According to legend, he will only die when Pollen has risen back to its former glory. In fact, not many believe him to be over 500 years old. He must come from a ruling caste that produces strong leaders in every generation, but doesn’t appear itself. The palace area is huge, with gardens, library and storage facilities: thousands of people could stay there without the rest of the city noticing. The bodyguards, the Druschinniks, are the only ones to ever see the Piast. Unwaveringly, they carry his orders into the different quarters and post them at the gates, maintaining the mystery surrounding their ruler.</p>\n<p>The Piast’s identity is not the only secret in the city. Wroclaw flourishes, but nothing grows outside its walls. Still it is said that there is no hunger in the twelve parts of the city. All parts of the city are separated by high walls and iron gates. It is unknown how many people live in Wroclaw. The Spitalians keep offering to enter the other quarters and tend to the sick. The Piast declines by default.

Still, the doctors had to give up the upper floors and retreat to blue basement labs. Here, mounted trilobites and bugs are stored in shelves and trunks, Biokinetics’ arms, legs and organs swim in glass cylinders, dissected Psychonauts lie in stainless steel tubs, a spore-afflicted brain has been sliced and awaits examination. Tin boxes with findings from Pandora have already been sealed and are ready to be sent to Borca’s Spital. Work stations with microscopes and typewriters line the walls.</p>\n<p>The labs are the domain of Consultant Dr. Janssen and her Primer research group. She thinks that the Primer can exit a host and return to its original form as a metaorganism if the environmental parameters like atmosphere and temperature are beyond the host’s adaptive range. The compromised host would no longer be suitable for the Primer. Thus, Dr. Janssen needs living Biokinetics she addresses as “Body” followed by a number in all her test records. Body 2 has become her hobby: a fleshy film covers the maximum security lab, groping for seams and hanging from the ceiling in flaps. Bones are swimming on the surface of the flesh, joined by cartilage and bone threads. A headsized bulge down by the door’s lower edge keeps expanding only to deflate again. Something dark presses against the shell before sinking back into the bulge’s wet carnality.

Instead, they began to reconstruct the old building five years ago. They built support struts, tore down the old roof and renovated the truss.

The Aberrant was leaning on a gnarled tree, its chest heaving from an arrow that had punctured his lungs. Streams of glowing orange liquid poured down its body, disrupting its natural camouflage. The creature snarled, scenting its hunters yet unable to locate them as they circled in from two sides, surrounding the Biokinetic.</p>\n<p>Gurkhan whistled like a woodcock to confuse their prey. This was Mara’s sign. With her bow drawn she rose from her parched cover and fired from a safe distance. The arrow whipped through the air and buried itself in the Migrant’s throat. The Aberrant bolted like a frenzied animal, thrashing around, spitting and hissing like a nest of stirred up rattlesnakes.</p>\n<p>This was Gurkhan’s chance. He dashed ahead, aiming his spear at the unarmored flank of the Migrant. With a swift motion he dodged the creature’s erratic rampage, burying the iron spearhead in the space between its ribs. The Aberrant roared and grabbed the weapon, trying to shatter it with its primordial strength. Gurkhan didn’t falter. He thrust the shaft deeper and drove the spear at an angle upward into the creature’s frame, until the tip pierced its heart.</p>\n<p>With a final gurgle the beast collapsed on the dusty terrain. Mara was close. “Gurkhan! There!” she yelled. A Rift Centipede the size of a man’s arm slithered through the dead leaves toward Gurkhan’s foot, ready to sink its venomous mandibles into its target. Gurkhan whirled around and grabbed the critter by its antennae, twisting it on its back before it could curl itself up into an armored ball. With a swift slice of his flintstone dagger he severed the Centipede’s head and hurled the snapping fangs far into the field. The headless body twitched and jerked about through the rustling foliage at his feet.</p>\n<p>Gurkhan did not hesitate and cut up the remains to lay open the flesh. He tore chunks of meat from the rigid exoskeleton, and hurriedly stuffed them in his mouth. He offered a large piece to Mara, who had just cracked open the fallen Aberrant's ribcage and was beginning to rummage through its entrails.</p>\n<p>“Eat!”</p>\n<p>“Not now,” she said under her breath. “We only have a few moments left. I can sense its powers waning.”</p>\n<p>Gurkhan nodded in agreement and wrapped the salvaged meat into a piece of leather, securing it to his belt. He looked back to his partner, watching her as she dug her hands into the steaming guts and yanked them from the Biokinetic’s belly. “What do we have?” he asked Mara.</p>\n<p>“Not much. This was just a newt. The gland is underdeveloped.”</p>\n<p>“Check for the bones,” Gurkhan suggested.</p>\n<p>Mara shook her head. “Brittle, not dense enough for weapons.

The Biokinetic Earth Chakra continuously pumped its spawn full of grotesquely altered information, giving them useless Psychonautic abilities, and influencing their genes in a way that might have made sense on the Primer’s home world. Here, the Biokinetics instead writhed in burning agony as their bodies transformed into caricatures of their former selves. Most of them died, the rest went mad. When the haze of Discordance died down, the Chakra realised it couldn’t save its Psychonauts and shed them, expelling the foul breed from the collective and beginning to shape a new generation.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>But something had survived the Discordance phenomenon. Buried deep within the earth beneath Pollen, a bloated cusp of pure life energy slumbered. The thick skin tube supplying it with nutritious ichor had already collapsed months before the Discordance tore through the ether. Interwoven with human DNA, protein molecules latched onto the being’s genes and rewrote the program. Stem cells specialized into phagocytes or brain cells, only to revert to their generic form shortly after. Calcium and other minerals fused to form teeth and bone sails. It was unstoppable.</p>\n<p>Following hints from locals in Pollen, a Corps of Preservists watched as the permafrost in the ruins of Lodz thawed in several circular areas for seemingly no reason. The so-far unknown phenomenon was termed a Hot Spot and ascribed to the Biokinetics – an incorrect assumption. They began excavation amidst the abandoned city, and found a crackling white bulk of nerves and muscles that emanated heat but died within minutes of being unearthed. Later, the Danzig Field Hospital received a hint concerning a decaying spore field near Lodz. The Preservists arrived just in time to witness a spore field’s complete metamorphosis into a Fractal Forest, gaudy green vegetation spreading through the valleys, translucent and pale trees sprouting up from the Sepsis coated ground in minutes. From afar, they watched attacks by Biokinetics and Husk Spiders and documented the Forest’s defenses. From now on, there could be no doubt that Hot Spots and Fractal Forests had nothing to do with the Earth Chakra. In time, the strange growth expanding beneath Pollen became known as the Czar, although the source of the name has never been officially revealed.</p>\n<p>Several elements within the Spitalians have realized that the Czar might be an opportunity for the Spital, and for humankind as well. Led by the Primer research group, Preservists have drilled a shaft into a nexus. They toiled for weeks to expose the flesh strand. In the light of the xenon lamps, teeth and spurs hardened within the mass and pushed outwards; in between them, eyeballs and prodding pseudopods grew. Rows of cartilage opened up. Muscle fiber contracted with whirring sounds. Communication was impossible this way, if it were even possible at all. At least six of the eight Consultants did not want any communication. This creature had to be destroyed while there was still a chance to do so. So the research continued in secret. The Primer research group fastened a Chronicler-made web of electrodes to the recoiling mass of flesh to measure excitement levels. In the first days, they recognized no pattern. The Czar was functional, but it was mindless. Now, however, the needle measures rising and falling levels of tension. The heat grows, the flesh strand sweats proteins, new protrusions of bone and teeth are discovered daily. Something is happening beneath Pollen, and it remains to be seen whether it will be good or bad for humanity.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>SEPSIS</h2>\n<p>THE PRIMER'S SEED</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Asteroids rained down, destroying and distorting everything. The Eurasian continental plate burst. Rivers ran dry or found a new bed. The Mediterranean Sea dried up and new coastlines rose. Volcanoes erupted. Deserts full of red dust spread. Then came a new Ice Age and uncountable deaths.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>All of this was inconsequential compared to the horrors to come. Embedded in the asteroids, deep within their carbon bonds and iron crystals, was evolution in its purest form: the Primer. It rose as a black mist, embedding microscopic spores into organic matter. The spores unraveled and coiled in fractal loops around the very DNA of its host, rebooting its genetic code and opening alternative pathways to corrupt.</p>\n<p>A few decades after the Eshaton, there was no life anywhere close to the craters. The Primer coated the glazed hills like a varnish. It persevered, absorbing fungal spores hidden within hollows sunken into the dust. The infection had begun. When humans first saw the fungal infestation, they thought the world itself was rotting. They called it “Sepsis”. Years later, fungal tomentum blanketed the craters. Its tendrils had sunk deep into the earth and spun into a wool-like mycelium that spread out in circular bursts. As programmed by the Primer, the mycelium pumped nutrients to the surface until it reached a critical mass. The ground swelled, the surface rupturing as fungi sprung from the cracks into the open air and quickly blossomed, jutting out all along the ridges in rich, fist-sized cusps of white. The mycelium exhausts the earth of nutrients and expands from the crater’s center, leaving the dry ground to tumble down in its wake. After years of equal growth and erosion, spore fields are strewn across almost every surface in the landscape, each reaching hundreds of meters in diameter. Concentric valleys and walls have emerged like ripples from a stone dropped into a once still pond.</p>\n<p>The spores of the Sepsis blanket the land, seeping into the lungs of anyone near a spore field. An adult’s cells are completely formed, and the Sepsis eats through them as if they were nothing but food. An unborn baby’s cells, on the other hand, are full of potential. Babies born close to Mother spore fields are different. Their eyes are as cold and lifeless as the starry sky. They don’t recognize their mothers, but they smell the milk, follow it like a bee follows the scent of nectar. They climb and claw their way up and onto the waiting breasts, suckling until there’s nothing left but blood and they are violently torn from the trough. These children are called Soulless Ones, Aberrants, or Psychonauts. They awaken a primordial fear in people. Many cannot stand it, taking the small body and bashing it against a stone until there is no life left within. Those that carry the children through the years see the changes. Insects trace patterns around them, drawing mandalas into the dust. They even wriggle up their legs, hiding in skin folds and hair. Yet these children never cry. While their kin wither, the Aberrants continue to flourish.</p>\n<p>Mother spore fields are bursting to the surface everywhere. They transform the land, forcing it to take on their image. In their troughs nestle the Psychonauts. Their number is growing, and wherever their domain intersects with Mankind’s, more crawl from pregnant women’s wombs. They take control, reaching for the crown of creation. Humankind stands at a crossroads. No less than its soul is at stake. The Eshaton was only the prelude. The final battle has begun.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"2AHdBHZoQAuxweJM"}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ieM8w4BeXJnt9Tn1"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"degenesis","systemVersion":"0.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677622742761,"modifiedTime":1677786373017,"lastModifiedBy":"OZIjrVbQoLiHLTla"},"ownership":{"default":0,"2qExmpp74cIKPqQF":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"bfsEprrosP8JvqZO"}

In the midday heat they retreat to libraries and the halls of ancient peoples. They’ve grown fond of the land, Seville is like a second Tripol to them.</p>\n<p>It seems as if the Neolibyan Consuls had always tightly controlled ancient Al Andalus in southern Hybrispania, but the borders were drawn with the blood of the Hybrispanian resistance fighters and African Scourgers.</p>\n<p>The pinpricks of the Guerreros deplete Cordoba and the Scourgers follow up by driving them into the jungles, gunning them down from their buggies, shots tearing into men, women and children alike.</p>\n<p>Fear and hatred take over. The Hybrispanians do anything for victory, planting explosive traps in the jungles and sneaking into the Africans’ homes at night, leaving with bloodied blades. Acts of mercy are punished - if not by the enemy, then by other Guerreros. Every Hybrispanian is instilled with the ideal of freedom and reconquest at birth. All around them their friends, brothers, sisters and compatriots rise to heroes in battle before falling in a hail of bullets the very next moment. These martyrs form the foundation of the Hybrispanian Culture, battle paintings adorn houses, songs are about preparing for death, children learn to read through texts teaching the use of weapons and jungle survival. Life falls by the wayside.</p>\n<p>The Scourgers are superior in number and weaponry. The Guerreros would have died out long ago if they hadn’t received help from the enigmatic Pregnoctics, strangers who delve into the stream of time and offer snippets of the future to the daring: whispering Scourger troop movements and the outcome of skirmishes ahead of time.</p>\n<p>Of course, the price for these snippets can be one’s soul.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;vertical-align:top;border-style:hidden;width:40%\">\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ATTRIBUTES &amp; SKILLS</h3>\n<p>⏵INTELLECT<br />⏵AGILITY</p>\n<p>⏵(BOD) Melee<br />⏵(AGI) Mobility<br />⏵(AGI) Stealth<br />⏵(INT) Medicine<br />⏵(INS) Orienteering</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h3>COMMON CULTS</h3>\n<p>⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.FPf7cjQk7Tyhl8KA]{Anubians}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.AsWh6KiJcS3jJc4T]{Apocalyptics}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.5lnvvHjSKXiFED9K]{Clanners}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.Fkp1CGSXlDA6wIJi]{Jehammedans}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.V5Dju1WcwYJUgRR5]{Neolibyans}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.ngw3ZpkZzU5S4tEF]{Palers}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.aQ1a7fSUx5uJiSlD]{Scourgers}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.71CrZLvw2P8NTqSR]{Scrappers}<br />⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cults.UiEuqxswx00k4Xwe]{Spitalians}</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>ARCHETYPE</h3>\n<img src=\"modules/the-stream/images/icon_archetype_hybrispania.webp\" alt width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"VqarDor7GXjDFwUX","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/header_culture_hybrispania.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"HISTORY","type":"text","_id":"XzyEn0sHNbOntfJw","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>HYBRIS</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>An asteroid fragment hit a mountain massif south of Toledo.

Little sacrifices to a big war and her painful, but victorious part in it.</p>\nMore than twenty years ago, at the court of the Neolibyan Jaafar in Cordoba, she went by her slave name, Ayana – Beautiful Flower. How the Africans misjudged her. Today, the Hybrispanian Guerreros know her as La Campeadora, the Fighting Woman.<br /><br />The Hybrispanians’ war bred great Guerreros. They came and went: torn by bullets, crushed under wheels, or chained between Scourger Koms and ripped apart. Their death inspired the survivors from whose ranks the next hero soon rose. They all spoke the language of war, were all legendary shots or close combatants, intuited enemy movements as if they were psychic. But none spoke the language of the people like La Campeadora. She talks softly, seems empathetic – all the while feeling the crowd’s mood, getting in tune with it. With every word, she leads her counterpart a little further along her way, singing her song of the beauty of the land and its proud people juxtaposes them with the slave work in the oil fields, tells of torture and the black devils bending even children until they break. Finally, she raises her voice, talks of those she has had to leave by the wayside, brave people full of passion and love, ripped from life by a disease that has gripped the land.<br /><br />If the Hybrispanians ever had something akin to a warlord in their battle against the invaders, it is La Campeadora.<br /><br />She leads by example, inciting tens of thousands to lie in ambush for days, to set thorn traps and creep into enemy camps. She inspects hideaways, weapons stores, and settlements. She talks to her Guerreros, raising new courage in those who seem broken. In the villages, she recruits children for her army, training them and living a life of resistance with them. Pale faces are hidden behind bark masks, bodies caked in mud race through the humid forests, spying, preparing traps, digging hideaways and placing messages in stumps. Every day in the jungle she makes them more resolute, fearing neither darkness nor torrents of rain nor thunder and lightning. For now, they only hunt small martens and rats with knives, but soon they will expand their hunt to humans. Renegados – the turncoats – and Africans.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>PROPHECY</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Scourgers are well armed, their morale is unbreakable, and no one has ever bested them in one-on-one combat.

Hybrispanians work as free people on the plantations, drink tea in an awning’s shadow with the Neolibyans and play Kalaha without having to fear the Scourge. Still they humbly look up to the Neolibyan Consuls who govern them from the Bygone palaces.

Hybrispanian communities elect them: they are mostly wise men and women who act as judges amongst their kin and resolve conflicts with the Africans.

Maybe the remains of these still exist in the Warpage’s deepest recesses, and with them their followers from times past.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>BROKEN FRONT</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>La Campeadora was outside Cordoba when the Nodes created the Warpage.

A jetty crookedly juts from the sand, inhabited by thousands of snails. Crabs flee from the surge or burrow into the sand. Trilobite shells dance on the surf. The water is clear, the beach is a shambles of mussel and sea snail shells. Some are the size of babies, covered in hollow spines and polished by the waves’ crashing. They glitter pale yellow and orange in the sunlight. These sea snails must have been hundreds of years old before a storm flood washed them ashore. Each of their shells is so heavy that a Scourger could not lift it from the sand on his own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Yet still, a miracle far more amazing waits in Lisbon Bay. A snail shell larger than a fishing boat – its lime spines casting shadows meters long, its surface pitted and sharp like broken basalt. Its opening points sideways, a maw with a pink bulge, surrounded by rows of finger-long spines. A grown man can enter the snail shell without having to duck. Within, it is cool, smells of musty seawater, the sound of the surf is muted. The walls’ mother-of-pearl shimmers and seems to glow from within – a part of the sunlight projected from the outside. In the twilight the delicate grooves in the wall, marking a year of life each, are visible. There are thousands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Those who enter the shell report dizziness and a permanent feeling of déjà vu. In the bulbous front part, the dome, the sound is broken and echoes hundredfold. Those who speak, hear their voice from behind before it becomes a distant thunder echoing continuously. The first coils into the tapering interior are easy to walk, the ground slick, but still easy to navigate. Soon, one loses their knowledge of up and down. The walls seem to vibrate. Memories of past and future attack the intruder while his perception bursts into a thousand fragments. He has to get out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Of course, not every Lisboan has dared enter the snail dome. Those who have penetrated deeper proudly report the coil they have reached, counted by the floor. Five is considered the limit, before the thing keeps your soul. Six more coils await those who dare to go further. In the warm midday light, everything looks much more enticing. Maybe it is the air within, or perhaps the shimmering of mother-of-pearl…</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Behind the monstrous thing, there are rows of two and three story buildings, all encrusted with snail shells to make them look like a cliff. Colorful scarves fly in their windows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Lisbon is the mariners’ city. The dhows built in her dry docks with their blue, triangular sails are nimble and sail close to the wind: even the Africans like these ships. Lisbon’s life happens at the waterfront. Jetties are added to houses, jibs are mounted to some. Boats lie bottom up on dry land, and kids scrape sea snails and barnacles from them. A group of Lisboans digs a future fairway and secures the sides against the sand sliding in with wooden planks. In backyards, bark is peeled from trees and cut into slats for smithies to produce fingerlong nails. Hemp is fashioned into ropes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Neolibyans have almost no ships on the Atlantic. Their maritime power is concentrated in the Mediterranean. Thus, Lisbon is almost without competitors when catering to the Atlantic market. Her merchants travel to Briton via Aquitaine to sell firewood and oil to the Anabaptists. However, the city is also a safe haven for a small group of African merchants calling themselves the Leopards. The Africans plan voyages to the Vulture’s domain from here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The permanent Hybrispanian conflict is not felt here. The hinterland is riddled by channels and thus impassable for the Scourgers’ off-road vehicles. The water is ripe with Trilobites and other spiny Primer varieties. Mussels cling to those who dare to enter it. The first steps and swimming strokes are easy, but the animals quickly accumulate until their weight drags the victim down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one reaches Lisbon by land, neither Africans nor Hybrispanians. The Lisboans avoid the war: they have always opposed the Spaniards’ invasion of Africa. What happens to their brothers and sisters in the east is their own fault.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"STORIES","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>LA CAMPEADORA</h2>\n<p>ICON OF RECONQUEST</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Cordoba took her left eye.

Scourge welts on the back at Malaga, another gunshot wound at Cartagena, in the leg this time. Little sacrifices to a big war and her painful, but victorious part in it. More than twenty years ago, at the court of the Neolibyan Jaafar in Cordoba, she went by her slave name, Ayana – Beautiful Flower. How the Africans misjudged her. Today, the Hybrispanian Guerreros know her as La Campeadora, the Fighting Woman.</span></p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>The Hybrispanians’ war bred great Guerreros. They came and went: torn by bullets, crushed under wheels, or chained between Scourger Koms and ripped apart. Their death inspired the survivors from whose ranks the next hero soon rose. They all spoke the language of war, were all legendary shots or close combatants, intuited enemy movements as if they were psychic. But none spoke the language of the people like La Campeadora. She talks softly, seems empathetic – all the while feeling the crowd’s mood, getting in tune with it. With every word, she leads her counterpart a little further along her way, singing her song of the beauty of the land and its proud people, juxtaposes them with the slave work in the oil fields, tells of torture and the black devils bending even children until they break. Finally, she raises her voice, talks of those she has had to leave by the wayside, brave people full of passion and love, ripped from life by a disease that has gripped the land.</p>\n<p>If the Hybrispanians ever had something akin to a warlord in their battle against the invaders, it is La Campeadora. She leads by example, inciting tens of thousands to lie in ambush for days, to set thorn traps and creep into enemy camps. She inspects hideaways, weapons stores, and settlements. She talks to her Guerreros, raising new courage in those who seem broken. In the villages, she recruits children for her army, training them and living a life of resistance with them. Pale faces are hidden behind bark masks, bodies caked in mud race through the humid forests, spying, preparing traps, digging hideaways and placing messages in stumps. Every day in the jungle she makes them more resolute, fearing neither darkness nor torrents of rain nor thunder and lightning. For now, they only hunt small martens and rats with knives, but soon they will expand their hunt to humans. Renegados – the turncoats – and Africans.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>THE WARPAGE</h2>\n<p>TIME FLIES</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>The Scourgers press north through every obstacle in their path. Fallen trunks and piles of rubble blocking the Bygone roads are cleared using explosive charges, pitfalls wide enough to swallow a Kom are swerved around, wires strung at neck height ready to decapitate an unfortunate rider are ducked under. They gain mile after mile. The forests of Hybrispania have been the Guerreros’ territory for the last 200 years, but the Scourgers are grinning; that will soon change.</p>\n<p>Leaves fall. How tranquil! The Koms cut through the deadfall like ships through a stormy sea. All the shades of red decay to a flickering gray. The Scourgers stop. It is midsummer. One of the group catches a leaf. It is an autumn brown, but the trees are full of sap. Their branches are immobile, as if chiseled from stone. The leaves are a strange bright green, but pristine. Still, they keep falling. The Scourgers stare into the heaving brown sky for a moment. They hear scraps of conversation in a foreign language. The air is grainy and heavy, and every word that leaves a Scourger’s lips only manages to travel a hand’s breadth of it. One of them tears down his mask and opens his mouth for a soundless cry. Silence engulfs the Africans.</p>\n<p>Later that day Jaafar, the Consul of Cordoba, will sadly notice that another Pride of Scourgers has not returned from their expedition. He pays it no mind, assuming they have fallen prey to the Guerreros and their traps. A week later, after several more Prides report unusual events in the woods, he is not so sure. They speak of ants spiraling into shapes without beginnings or ends, and swarms of jackdaws assembling into formations so tightly packed they black out the sun. They see people dressed in Bygone clothes that disappear when approached. They feel the air change, hear a cracking sound in their ears, see prismatic effects smearing the world around them. Strange smells confuse the senses as everything slows to a crawl and sounds suddenly have a color. The Consul has no choice. He orders his Scourgers to halt their advance through the forests. He cannot afford to lose more.</p>\n<p>Something is happening in the jungle between Madrid and Al-Andalus. Bizarre phenomena ripple through the forests, twisting the linear flow of time into new and unnatural shapes. Reality threatens to burst at the seams. This is the Warpage, an area of distorted space-time expanding outwards in a triangle centered around the Mirar crater. Inside, time has been detached from the normal flow of the universe, shifting its directions, speeding up and slowing down in a seemingly random pattern. Animals are caught in pockets that cast their genetic data back millions of years, altering their DNA to a more primitive form. Others find themselves stuck in a space where millions of years pass for every second on the outside, thousands of generations of mutation and evolution taking place before their descendants are allowed to exit a few minutes later. Now, strange, hyper-adapted creatures lurk in the shadows of the trees, ready to pounce on anything that comes close.</p>\n<p>The points of the Warpage’s triangle are marked by three Nodes, Pregnoctics who are powerful enough to erase entire timelines with a single word. Each of them represents an aspect of time - past, present, or future - but only one is known: Enigma, the Node commanding the present, resides at the north-western extent. Her entire domain is locked into a permanent stasis, no event from the past can affect it, and nothing can change the fate of anything trapped inside. Only a select few are permitted to enter the frozen landscape, descend to her sunken castle, and request her aid. The other Nodes are completely unknown to humans; in the north-east, near Cuenca, the Node of the past dwells in a bubble of time flowing in reverse. The moment one steps across the border they are caught in the paradox of simultaneously stepping backwards out of it. They will spend an eternity on the event horizon.</p>\n<p>While the northern reaches of the Warpage are strange, dangerous, and distorted, they are still relatively stable. The Aberrants freely move through the area, and even some humans can survive there. However, the south is far more volatile. Something has gone wrong due to the Discordance washing over the region, and the Node of the future has been tainted by its influence. People stumble into time traps, caught in metaphysical nets and torn from their world never to return. Ancient cities burst from the past into a sunlit jungle, tower there in their ancient glory for a few hours, and relapse, tearing apart trees and taking entire villages with them. 500 year old Recombination Group radio transmissions crackle in the Chroniclers’ receivers as if they had just been sent. The tides of time surging towards Cordoba become more frequent and violent, forcing the Cácarru, the only Clan which has been able to live within the altered space, to uproot their temporary camps more often in the last year than in the decade before. The Pregnoctics talk of the future Node’s screams rippling back through history to pollute the Chakra ether, drowning out their predictions and crippling their accuracy. Tensions are rising.</p>\n<p>The Warpage has changed Hybrispania in a way it will never recover from, and its inhabitants have had no choice but to adapt. For the Guerreros it is both a blessing and a curse; it prevents the invaders from bypassing the coasts and striking at the Castilian plateau through the jungles, but at the same time it forces the freedom fighters to emerge from their comfort zone in the dark underbrush and fight on the outskirts of the forests where the trees are sparse and they are left without cover. On the other side of the conflict, the Scourgers see the distortion as an affront to nature itself, a region where even their ancestors cannot protect them. If they had not already lost hundreds of Prides to its reality-twisting devastation, they would have mounted a mass expedition to try and destroy it at its core. As it is, they regularly send Prides further north in an attempt to reach one of the stable Nodes and kill them - all unsuccessful, so far.</p>\n<p>Even the unaligned elements on the fringes of the war for the peninsula have been affected. In Salamanca, the Spitalian research base pays well for samples of biomass that have been shunted into a different reference frame, the doctors all scribbling frantic notes as they watch lumps of flesh and plantlife age backwards under their microscopes. Hellvetic radio specialists have been showered with everything valuable that the Guerreros have been able to scrounge up and tasked with developing a decryption protocol that can compensate for the interference of the time distortion, but even these masters of communication struggle to adjust to messages received before they were sent. Meanwhile, to the Scrappers of Hybrispania, the Warpage is nothing but an opportunity. Legends have spread for years about the pristine artifacts that have been scavenged from deep within its borders, so clean and well-preserved that it’s like they just rolled off the production line. Every year, more dirt diggers delve into the heart of Hybrispania. Most of them never return.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"2AHdBHZoQAuxweJM"}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ieM8w4BeXJnt9Tn1"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"degenesis","systemVersion":"0.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677622742761,"modifiedTime":1677784854331,"lastModifiedBy":"OZIjrVbQoLiHLTla"},"ownership":{"default":0,"2qExmpp74cIKPqQF":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"kdhSnsohRc3jTzi7"}

It takes a wanderer by the hand and shows him the extremes of nature. Storms rage across the plains, making the endless forests’ treetops tremble. When the gates of heaven open up, it does not rain, it pours – torrents push down into the valleys, joining to form riptides. Gnarled trees clutch the ground, refusing to give in to nature’s powers. The winters are cold and implacable, snow piles meters high in the mountains, swallowing the conifer forests, while in summer, the sun singes the grassy plains to yellow fields of stubble. The Balkhan never finds rest. It groans and screams, but never gives up, for every battle makes it stronger and more rebellious.</p>\n<p>The land is just like its people, untamed, proud warriors of a proud nation. Hospitality means everything to them, but one wrong word is enough, and years of peace lose their meaning. The table is toppled, plates and cups rattle across the floor, and old friends meet as enemies. They love and laugh as they hate and fight: driven by passion, with no compromise. They love strength and competition. Maybe that is why so many of them gather under a warlord’s banner in the Voivodates. In Beograd, Dalmatia and Sofia, they build their future only to tear it down. They celebrate, hit each other, and make up again.</p>\n<p>Threats unite them: Together, they attack enemy Voivodates, Africans, Spitalians, or Psychonauts. Side by side they stand, with no room in-between. However, once they have triumphed over an enemy, the wind turns, and old alliances are discarded like worn jackets. No one is more loyal and more fearsome than a Balkhani.</p>\n<p>Even within the family, a single word can have the destructive power of a grenade.

However, it harbors dissonances. The Dushani must tune it to survive. In caverns they staunch water to vary the pitches until they are in full harmony, in valleys they plant trees to break the wind or derail its vibrations into the ground, they place stones in streams and rivers to bring their gurgling into harmony with the treetops’ rustling.

At the center of this phenomenon, the concrete slabs have burst in the pattern of thousands of Dushani Chakras. The signs are repeated on the walls, as if cut into the stone. Those who stand still and listen closely feel the voices. They undulate, varying in volume and pitch. The Balkhani say the buildings are telling the city’s story in a language that no one can understand.

Daylight is green and caresses the ground in waves. Acorns crack underfoot with a high-pitched clink. Every step aches, every sound rears up and bursts into acoustic splinters of glass amidst the trees. Behind an oak, there is another pillar and another one. They form a semi-circle. Between them, hulking colossi stand, eaten by verdigris and moss-covered. Porous hands rest on swords, birds nest in crowns, carapaces are broken, their interior home to ants: the Judges.</p>\n<p>In former times, the Judges guarded this city. For centuries, they silently stared into the semicircle’s center. Here, the queen amongst the pillars once towered high into the clouds, arm extended up to the sky. When she collapsed, the angel on top fell as well. One of its bronze wings juts from the broken torso, almost parallel to the ground, like a table or an altar. Like an invitation. Animal skulls are piled on top and beneath, black and moldy, all without a lower jaw.</p>\n<p>The birds fall silent. They know the signs. Subtonal chants rise, catch the foliage in intertwining waves. The air shimmers and sinks to the ground, grass bends, the wet deadfall is pressed to the ground so hard that water trickles from it and forms puddles. They remain still, reflecting the light like mercury.</p>\n<p>Further away, a river cuts through the sea of ruins. On it, unmoving waves and whirls form, some of them are hard and edged like glass. A rat races across the surface, its feet leave a bloody trail. It loses a toe, then another. It panics, hits a wave that tears the skin from its body. In the end, it stumbles, its feet stumps drawing lines on the water turned glass. It falls. Vibrating ribs break the skin, the flesh melts and dissipates into dancing droplets. Below it, Bog Krakens glide through the river, breaking the surface with their bodies as if nothing has happened.</p>\n<p>The chants engulf the whole sea of ruins. Buildings tremble until their edges appear fuzzy. Those who dare touch them get their fingertips grated. Animals flee underground, the sound of rustling leaves and wind is swept away. The Dushani weave their web all across Pest, engulf the spore fields and their nests, pile up frequencies, entwine and spread them. All over the Balkhan, the Aberrants sway to the rhythm of the songs of Pest.</p>\n<p>It takes hours for the waves to break. Swarms of flies rise above the treetops again, rats and Gendos start looking for prey. Bog Krakens leave the river and crawl up to the large Mother spore fields’ walls. Their tentacles grope for the Dushani, entangle arms and legs and pull their bulky body up to the shoulders where they take in the sweet vibrations, change color, and constrict.</p>\n<p>The Balkhani avoid the ruins. No Voivodate lays claim to this accursed place. Only the most reckless of Apocalyptics dare to enter the spore fields, attracted by the Burn. Those who survive longer than a few days have learned one thing: he may not disturb one stone, he must be silent. All of Pest is a giant amplifier for the Dushani wave, and every building, every hill, and every body of water is included. Any disturbance, even if it is only a cracked branch, multiplies as a dissonance through the wave and makes the Aberrants rise. One thing is for sure: they will eliminate the disturbance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>BREAKING OF THE WAVE</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chernobog has come.

The city surrounded it with housing areas, markets, brothels, inns, arsenals and fortress walls. From its shadow, warlords rode to battle and armies spread to the surrounding area. The Twin Tower promises power and continuity.</p>\n<p>The Voivodes descended from the Djuric dynasty have been using it for exactly 100 years now. Celebrations to honor the first Djuric call the people to the streets and the free inns, make them drink, laugh, and forget for a while. There is a lot to forget. For Beograd has enemies.</p>\n<p>After a typhus wave last summer, the current Voivode accused the Spitalians of brewing poison and infecting his people, even after they had fought the epidemic in vain for weeks.

On his morning ride through the quarters, some of those migratory birds had emptied their chamber pots onto the street in front of his feet. The laughter from their houses was pure poison in his ears – they should have learned from the Spitalians. Djuric had them driven out of their brothels and joints. Pushed them into their own piss and finally relocated them into a ghetto. By day, they can come and go, but they may not carry weapons. At night, the gate closes. The breed must stay among its own ilk. Who is laughing now?</p>\n<p>The Usudi from the mountains are another nuisance. They throng the trade routes, trap travelers and eat their flesh. Nothing unusual thus far. In the mountains, there is a lot of scum that henchmen drive down to the plains to kill them there. The heads will adorn the walls for a season. However, those Usudi wake a primordial fear even in Djuric’s assassins. They are nightmarish creatures without fear or brains, dehumanized and deadly. Even the smallest scratches lead to putrid blisters when an Usudi is around. They pollute the air and the soul. The people consider them a bad omen.</p>\n<p>These days, it doesn’t take a prophet to read the signs. Dalmatian agitators assault the Voivodate with shock troops. Spies report that Karakhan in Sofia has expanded the walls of his fortress and drafted more soldiers. At the same time, the Black God’s Clans advance from the northwest.

In wide curves, the river meanders through the plain and makes it fertile. Forests give way to dense shrubbery and wide areas covered with stubborn grass and rocky plateaus.

The Voivode calls them customs offices, but everybody knows that these fortresses are not only there to keep smugglers away.<br /><br />Sofia itself lies on the northern slope of the Witoscha Mountains. Ramrod-straight streets lead past palaces adorned with pillars, metal-covered buildings and dusty apartment blocks. Some end in giant plazas, others get lost in the forests’ proliferation. The Voivode’s palace is an octagonal hall clutched in steel ribs that would have room enough for dozens of Surge Tanks.<br /><br />He rarely can be found there. Instead, he is outside, talking to his tax collectors, watching his guards exercise, commending and degrading. Emissaries and spies run to him, give their weapons to his guards, have to fall in step and keep up with him to say what they have to say. He listens, gives orders. Everybody knows that he does not discuss things. The city around him and its ability to put up a fight grow with every dispatch he dictates to his messengers. Roads eat further into the plateau day by day, connecting Sofia to agricultural settlements and watchtowers. On the Botew’s peak, a radio mast rises.

Large areas within the old municipal area are dotted with poles, rib cages jut from deadfall and shrubbery, arrows and spears rot in the underbrush.</p>\n<p>Then, the Jehammedans came. They steeped the tribes in their religion or crushed them between their warriors’ fronts. They prayed and preached at historical sites in the city – at the Stavropoleos Church and the Cathedral of the Patriarchs, as well as in the monumental ruins of the House of the Republic. Their goat herds grazed in the overgrown city canyons.</p>\n<p>Life flowed back into the city.</p>\n<p>However, Bucharest’s splendor awakened desires.</p>\n<p>In the Adriatic lowlands, Jehammedans and Anabaptists were entangled in a static battle. Now, beaten and blooddrenched Isaaki demanded aid so that Bucharest might prove itself worthy of Jehammed’s mercy. Bucharest sent her best soldiers. They were missing when the Africans crossed the Bosporus and rumbled towards the city in their Surge Tanks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>THEY SOW THE WIND...</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Territorial Region IV, not far from Laibach.

Three Surge Tanks had been given to him by the Bank of Commerce, and hundreds of Scourgers followed. He invited friends of his family and Sheikhs to attend a very special kind of hunt from the mobile fortresses’ platforms. Soon, according to his plan, every minute he had invested would pay off in sacks of Dinars</p>\n<p>This summer, he’d storm Bucharest, close off the whole southern Balkhan, and send his Scrappers into the Paler bunkers to rip the last riches from this land’s realm of roots. He’d already had his face cast in silver – he’d wear the mask for his victory parade through Tripol, shortly before being declared a Sheikh at the Bank of Commerce.</p>\n<p>The army started marching. The Surge Tanks ate away the kilometers, day by day. Zuberi’s Cartographer made note of every inch of ground they won, and he smiled. All went according to plan. In three more weeks, they would reach Bucharest.</p>\n<p>The Africans passed the Voivodate Ionnus. As an enemy of Bucharest and buried under a pile of Dinars, it was supposed to stay calm. Zuberi was irritated when the Voivode of the area, Neven, asked for a sit-down. Did he come to bargain for more? In the face of this unstoppable army? Was he mad?</p>\n<p>However, Neven praised Zuberi’s generosity and strength with grand gestures. He did not want gold, of that he really had enough. He waved away this notion. He wanted glory and revenge against Bucharest. He put his cavalry into Zuberi’s services for the first strike.</p>\n<p>Zuberi was baffled but happy. Let the savages kill each other! That meant that less valuable African blood would spill. Moreover, it would be that much easier to conquer the Voivodate Ionnus.</p>\n<p>The days flew by. Neven’s scouts raced ahead, sometimes reporting rock falls and impassable plateaus, sometimes encountering overflowing rivers. Minor details. Nothing the Cartographer had not seen coming and was able to counteract with minor deviations.</p>\n<p>In three days, they would see Bucharest’s towers. Neven asked for a last long rest for himself and his riders, a celebration of their ancestors next to which they would soon dine. Zuberi loved the idea. A little folklore and gluttony, and his rather bored guests would be looking forward to the finale.</p>\n<p>The Voivode had chosen a spot, a fallow field with good visibility on all sides. No enemy would be able to creep up on them. The Surge Tanks formed an open fortress triangle: the fires would be lit in the center of it. Soon, the party was in full swing, goats were roasting over the fire, bread was served from earthen ovens. Only the Scourgers refrained from the celebration and guarded the platforms. Night fell on Zuberi’s army. Chains of lights lit up with a flicker. Zuberi had outdone himself.</p>\n<p>So had Neven. He felt the heat of the fire on his face. He was alone. The songs and the rhythmic clapping only sounded muffled through the Surge Tank’s armored hull. He stood in front of the furnace. The Petro tanks were all in the back part of the fortress, encased in centimeters of steel. “They have thought of everything”, he said aloud, reached for the bag next to him and threw it into the furnace. The fabric caught fire with a bang, smoldered and tightened over its contents. More than a dozen fist-sized egg-shaped stones were visible underneath the burning fabric. The Voivode creased his brow and closed his eyes. Never would he surrender his country to the black devils.</p>\n<p>The grenades detonated with a flash, followed by a barrel of flame that vaporized the engine room and roared against the armored hull. The Surge Tank bucked, the outer shell burst outwards. Molten metal rained down to the ground, hitting a layer of niter that Neven’s henchmen had hidden under the ground days ago. The fire was searing hot, eating deeper and deeper into the ground. Until it reached the buried niter barrels – Neven’s legacy, and parting gift to the Balkhan.</p>\n<p>The detonation was not heard in Bucharest, but the flash of light far in the southeast was like a sunrise to the city.</p>\n<p>When the news reached Tripol, the Sheiks quickly agreed that no one could have survived the fireball – how many more good Africans should these mountain lunatics kill? Zuberi’s life and dream had ended, and the Bank of Commerce called a stop to the conquest of the Balkhan.</p>\n<p>Somewhere deep down in Justitian’s Central Cluster, someone croaked with laughter. The Fragment, Impulse, watched the destruction of Zuberi’s army through his drone’s scratchy optical recordings. As long as he lived, no one would touch his ancestors’ land again, of that he was sure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>DISSOLUTION</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Bucharest is surrounded by wolves.

Their baths were only used by them, Ismaelis with sabers kept the city’s inhabitants away. Whole streets and quarters were cut out of the Balkhanis’ loud everyday life.</p>\n<p>There was an ancient pact between the Zlatan Voivode dynasty and Dalmatia’s Iconides that determined which area belonged to the native Balkhani and which one belonged to the Jehammedans. According to legends, it dated back to the original Zlatan brothers. After vanquishing the Dalmatian Clans, one of them chose a worldly life with all its amenities, while the other chose to be one of the Isaaki and was taken up in the Cult’s religious rites and eventually declared an Iconide. Three generations adhered to the pact. Jehammedans and Dalmatians watched each other skeptically and derided each other: the latter because they considered the religious rigmarole nonsensical, the former because they considered the Balkhani to be children who still needed to find themselves and God… but it was too late.</p>\n<p>The Voivode had become old and mild, his toadying before the Iconide a habit. Until the Boyar Buzdovan took heart, grabbed a morning star with a long handle from the throne chamber’s wall, and smashed old Zlatan’s skull. The other Boyars did not budge. Buzdovan shoved them away and marched out, dragging his weapon. The weapon’s bloody, spiked ball painted red lines on the floor. Outside, he hefted the morning star and shouted: “Freedom!”</p>\n<p>Buzdovan forced the Boyars to recognize him as Voivode and sent his henchmen against all who did not tell him what he wanted to hear. He declared the Jehammedans outlawed: those who got their hands on them first could claim their assets. Assassins took care of rival Boyars, and Buzdovan awarded or took away new titles and privileges almost every day. Jehammedans were sold into slavery, Apocalyptics hunted to death like animals. He first curried favor with the Anabaptists and then pushed them into a pit full of hungry Gendos. Every midday the bells toll to remember the hour of freedom. In the market place, there is a bowl of gold, and those who dare to touch it forfeit their lives.</p>\n<p>Day by day, Buzdovan comes up with new rituals and customs to demonstrate culture and strength to his torn people. However, the Dalmatians have tasted the sweet nectar of freedom. Some of them set their hopes on their Voivode’s impact, let themselves be swept along by his desire for the title of Boyar. Others gather to control the black market and slave trade. Buzdovan may be paranoid, but not without reason. Indeed he believes he knows the hour of his death. Deep within the catacombs under his throne chamber, he keeps an Icon in a steel shrine. According to legend, it gives an Isaaki wearing it in combat the strength and confidence to topple Dalmatia’s Voivode. He could have destroyed it.

He looked back at his son, who followed ten paces away through the heavy underbrush. “Once you lick off all the honey, you have to eat shit for the rest of your life.” Novak didn’t challenge his father’s words. He accepted Beomir’s truisms as if they were a law of nature.</p>\n<p>“What’s the difference in a man’s beard?” Beomir questioned his son.</p>\n<p>“There are three kinds of beards,” the boy replied.</p>\n<p>“Explain!” Beomir’s demand was clear as day.</p>\n<p>“There are beards of wisdom. And beards of honor,” Novak recounted.</p>\n<p>Beomir turned toward his son, his face grim and full of expectation. “The third?”</p>\n<p>Novak exhaled. “Beards full of shit?” he asked coyly.</p>\n<p>Instantly, father and son burst into laughter.</p>\n<p>They had reached a part of the forest that was foreign to Novak. This was forbidden territory. Not even the Jehammedans dared to mark their claims in this region. A week had passed since they had left the village, yet Novak still didn’t know the purpose of their journey.</p>\n<p>\"How long until we’re there?”</p>\n<p>“How old are you again?” Beomir asked in return.</p>\n<p>“Eleven. Why?”</p>\n<p>“Why does it matter to an eleven year old how long this march takes? You still have a long life ahead of you, son. Keep moving!”</p>\n<p>Novak complied reluctantly. “Do Jehammedans wear beards?”</p>\n<p>“Of course they do, even their women! You’ve never seen one? They’re fat and ugly, and they breed hairy children with single eyebrows.”</p>\n<p>Novak shuddered at the thought. He couldn’t tell if his father was joking. Beomir stepped out of the shadow of an old tree and began climbing a mossy slope. “Follow along!”</p>\n<p>Novak struggled to grasp the vines and roots jutting from the wet forest floor as he pulled himself toward the top. He panted. His backpack weighed him down. Beomir reached for his hand and dragged him up across the last stretch. He patted the boy’s shoulder to help him catch a breath. A clearing lay in front of them, bathed in golden sunlight and covered in velvet flowers.</p>\n<p>“We’re here. This is the spot.”</p>\n<p>Novak frowned. He couldn’t identify anything of interest. There was nothing but a field of violets ahead, framed by the trees of this old forest. Bees buzzed through the sunshine, and pollen flew around in the air. A handful of birds chirped in the distance.</p>\n<p>“Are we plucking flowers for mother?” Novak asked, full of doubt.</p>\n<p>“Grab me the flat rock over there. Yes, that one!” Beomir ordered with a sigh and squatted next to his son. “I want you to watch the clearing. This is a special place. You only get to see this once in life, so pay attention.” With a swift move he hurled the stone far across the field of violets. Novak squinted his eyes, trying to notice anything. Suddenly, all the flowers in the field twisted their heads towards where the rock had landed. The petals opened and closed in unison as if they communicated amongst each other, forming a perfect circle surrounding the rock, heaving their leaves as if they were conducting a ceremony. Novak was stunned. He watched on as the bees clustered and began to orbit the same area, spawning a strange symbol in the air with their flight formation.</p>\n<p>“What is going on?”</p>\n<p>“Not what. Why.” Beomir whispered bleakley. “Beyond this field lies the land of the Dushani. You understand?” Novak gasped. He was scared. He only knew of the Dushani from the folklore of the village, which said that they feasted on the souls of humans.</p>\n<p>“Out there, madness reigns. Once you cross over to the other side you lose your mind and become their thrall. Nothing can beat them. We can only avoid them, never engage them.”</p>\n<p>Novak kept staring at the clearing with an open mouth, trying to comprehend the unreal display, when all of a sudden a slap hit him across the face. The boy crashed into the forest floor, cheek burning red hot from his father’s surprising strike. Beomir towered above him, with clenched fists and hardened features. Novak had never seen him so angry. He panicked, and lifted his arms above his head to shield himself from another blow.</p>\n<p>“I love you boy, and I must protect you,” Beomir thundered. “You will never return to this place. You will never cross this field. And you will teach your children and grandchildren the same.” Novak’s heart raced in fear. What had gotten into his father? Why was he beating him?</p>\n<p>“You will never forget the day I hurt you,” Beomir yelled. “For if you don’t heed my words and fall prey to the Dushani, I will have to murder you.” He grabbed his son by the shoulders and lifted him back on his feet. Carefully he brushed the leaves and moss from his clothes and pressed the boy against his belly. Novak trembled. Tears flushed from his eyes and ran across his burning cheek. He sobbed quietly, trying to understand his father's outburst. But he could not. He could only stare out into the field and watch the violets as Beomir stroked his hair and rubbed his back to calm him down.</p>\n<p>“Let’s get back home.

That meant that less valuable African blood would spill. Moreover, it would be that much easier to conquer the Voivodate Ionnus later.</p>\n<p>The days flew by. Neven’s scouts raced ahead, sometimes reporting rock falls and impassable plateaus, sometimes encountering overflowing rivers. Minor details. Nothing the cartographer had not seen coming and was able to counteract with minor deviations.</p>\n<p>In three days, they would see Bucharest’s towers. Neven asked for a last long rest for himself and his riders, a celebration of the ancestors next to which they would soon dine. Zuberi loved the idea. A little folklore and gluttony, and his rather bored guests would be looking forward to the finale.</p>\n<p>The Voivode had chosen a spot, a fallow field with good visibility on all sides. No enemy would be able to creep up on them. The Surge Tanks formed an open fortress triangle; the fires would be lit in the center of it. Soon, the party was in full swing, goats were roasting over the fire, bread was served from earthen ovens. Only the Scourgers refrained from the celebration and guarded the platforms. Night fell on Zuberi’s army. Chains of lights lit up with a flicker. Zuberi had outdone himself.</p>\n<p>So had Neven. He felt the heat of the fire in his face. He was alone. The songs and the rhythmic clapping only sounded muffled through the Surge Tank’s armored hull. He stood in front of the furnace. The tanks were all in the back part of the fortress, encased in centimeters of steel. “They have thought of everything,” he said aloud, reached for the bag next to him and threw it into the furnace. The fabric caught fire with a bang, smoldered and tightened over its contents. More than a dozen fist-sized stones or eggs were visible underneath the burning fabric. The Voivode creased his brow and closed his eyes. Never would he surrender his country to the black devils.</p>\n<p>The grenades detonated with a flash, followed by a barrel of flame that vaporized the engine room and roared against the armored hull. The Surge Tank bucked, the outer shell burst outwards. Molten metal rained down to the ground, hitting a layer of niter that Neven’s henchmen had applied days ago. The fire was searing hot, eating deeper and deeper into the ground. Until it reached the buried niter barrels – Neven’s legacy and gift to the Balkhan.</p>\n<p>The detonation was not heard in Bucharest, but the flash of light far in the southeast was like a sunrise to the city.</p>\n<p>When the news reached Tripol, the Sheikhs quickly agreed that no one could have survived the fireball – how many more good Africans should these mountain lunatics kill? Zuberi’s life and dream had ended, and the Bank stopped the conquest of the Balkhan.</p>\n<p>Somewhere deep down in Justitian’s Central Cluster, someone croaks with laughter. The Fragment Impulse watched the destruction of Zuberi’s army through his drone’s scratchy optical recordings. As long as he lived, no one would touch his ancestors’ land again, of that he was sure.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h2>ECHO STELAE</h2>\n<p>RESONANCE AMPLIFIERS</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:20%\"></col><col style=\"width:80%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<p><strong>REFERENCE<br /></strong><strong>⏵</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"storytextblock\">\n<div class=\"storytextblock-inner\">\n<p>They rise across the mountains of the Balkhan. Granite monoliths, perfectly smooth, towering over the rugged fields of this strange landscape. They appear without any warning, but are always heralded by an intense Dushani song, and are scattered seemingly at random throughout the region. Even the closest examination shows no evidence of tools being used to chisel the faint patterns into the solid stone, no drills, no saws, only pristine rock. However, anyone who dares to mark the stele, thereby breaking the circles and wave patterns carved into the surface, will face immediate repercussions. A sonic cascade billows out of nowhere, atomzing the intruder into a cloud of blood-colored mist.</p>\n<p>The Balkhan has been shaped and molded by the Dushani sound waves since the Rapture first emerged, and the stelae are part of this terraforming process. The patterns on their surface are of geometric origin, and are reminiscent of how sand grains arrange themselves when exposed to the effects of cymatics: vibrational ornaments. The Spitalians assume that the placement of each monolith is chosen according to the very specific needs of the Rapture. As a result, the stelae reflect and amplify the song of the Dushani, enhancing their psychotic lullaby and magnifying its strength to new heights. This also causes any discordant noise within the sound carpet coating the Balkhan to echo and reverberate, ensuring that any Aberrant listening is able to detect intruders or disturbances, and eliminate them immediately.</p>\n<p>In the past, the Spitalians acted quickly and tried to blow up these rock formations on sight, but this has now changed. In recent years the Cult has had to redeploy several platoons away from the area, as the region destablized and it became near impossible to gain support from the locals. Any advance into the heart of the Balkhan is now at a standstill, yet more and more of the stelae are documented by lone Preservists still operating in the field. The only logical way to progress would be to destroy all of the stone towers simultaneously, but the sheer logistics of such an operation would require a massive shift of priorities for the Spital. Additionally, too many Spitalians have met their end in the clutches of a Dushani, and the Cult has retreated from further action until a new plan is devised.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"2AHdBHZoQAuxweJM"}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ieM8w4BeXJnt9Tn1"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"degenesis","systemVersion":"0.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677622742761,"modifiedTime":1677725845502,"lastModifiedBy":"OZIjrVbQoLiHLTla"},"ownership":{"default":0,"2qExmpp74cIKPqQF":3},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"o1Cszc2PLHYGpW0i"}
