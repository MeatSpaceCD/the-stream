Those left behind felt cheated and angry against the supposed betrayers, driven by their own fear, while the bunker crew had to resign in helplessness. Out there were relatives and acquaintances, many left partners and children to an uncertain fate. Isolation had just begun when the inmates already wanted it to end. However, the catastrophe became the apocalypse. The Reaper’s Blow split the Alps like a divine axe blow. The mountains broke open, stone avalanches splintered from the breaking point, crashed down with a deafening noise and buried rising magma under millions of tons of stone, a fragile seal on Pandora’s Box. The Alpine Fortress was mortally wounded. The great access gates caved in or were buried under rubble. Tunnels that had led into hangars and barracks only yesterday now ended in dizzying heights and opened onto newly formed valleys. Deep black, toxic columns of smoke curled skywards, searing heat welled up. The mountain had become a prison.</p>\n<p>Complete sections were cut off from the core, the fate of the Swiss living there was unknown. Most of the castaways belonged to the civilian branch and were responsible for the reconstruction. Without them…</p>\n<p>The military fought on, unwilling to give up on comrades and civilians.

A year before, recon specialists had first managed to cross the Reaper’s Blow. However, their expectations were not met. Two sections in which the Hellvetics had hoped to find their high command and the government’s representatives had caved in. Not even ashes remained. Should all the sweat, all the blood have been in vain? The military apparatus teetered. Throughout these years, it had clung to this single goal, now its heart and its brain had been ripped from its body. Empty and burnt-out, it stared into a bleak future.</p>\n<p>The Hellvetic Leonhard Gboy managed to save the day. A rationing plan and several improvised leadership institutions caught the survivors in a net of bureaucracy and new goals. A Corps Commander who had to guarantee the area’s safety autonomously was assigned to all of the Swiss Territorial Regions. He commanded smaller units of a few dozen soldiers that were supposed to be constantly checked for quality by an independent section commission. The chain of command was restored, and the Hellvetics felt like they were part of a Swiss clockwork machine again. One thing remained to be done.

Additional tunnels, corridors, and halls were drilled into the mountain as the influence of the Hellvetics spread. These transfer tunnels allowed strangers to pass under the Alps and the Reaper’s Blow, for a fee. Anabaptists could cross the Alpine passes from Borca to Purgare.

Only in Bern was there an independent representation of the people that was not allowed to raise a militia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Now the Hellvetics have left the cantons to their own devices. Their city fortresses are manned by Swiss with old-fashioned rifles and pikes. Only the roads and way stations are still guarded by the Hellvetics. They say the transfer tunnels and passes are safe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Territorial Region III with its vast territory covering all of former Austria needs a far more offensive approach than the heartland. Genie squads have been tunneling through the mountains for centuries, laying subterranean rails in an attempt to make up for the Hellvetics’ relatively small numbers with maximum mobility. The chances of passing through the Alps in this area without being noticed are decreasing with every passing year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Territorial Region IV is mainly unchartered territory encompassing Purgare and the Balkhan. The Hellvetics’ fortresses are unfinished buildings, tunnels carved into the rock without camouflage or security mechanisms. They are only sparsely manned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">On the Alps’ Purgan side, the known passes and transfer tunnels are constantly watched by Anabaptists and Jehammedans. In the Balkhan, on the other hand, the Voivodes are in control. They stop those that are unwanted in their realm at the exits to the passages.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>CUTS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nThe Reaper’s Blow south of the Alps is a highly active volcanic area.

With them, hosts of lice and ticks come pouring into the fortress, obliterated in the hellfire but still coming. The Hellvetics are used to having human enemies.

Ever since then, Hellvetics have been graded on their combat performance based on being awarded and penalised merit points. This score, together with workshops they have taken and skills they have acquired and demonstrated, determines a soldier’s grade. <br /><br />After every tour, all Hellvetics involved must face a public assessment and judgment in their section. To this end, their Trailblazers have a socket at the base of their receiver so that they can be accessed via a computer port in front of the drill hall’s plasma screen. The number of shots fired is recorded, as well as the rate of fire or any overheating by continuous fire. <br /><br />Once the weapon has been checked, the soldier turns to his comrades and awaits their judgment. Behind him, his data flickers across the wall-sized display, accompanied by his combat statistics and his commander’s effectiveness assessment. The reactions vary from respectful silence to scornful humiliation. <br /><br />At the end of these assessment ceremonies, the section computer determines how much ammo is left for this month and creates a new ranking of the most efficient sections.

They attacked each other over handfuls of corn, killing and looting. Some claimed their circumstances were to blame. Centuries of ethical and moral development were gone with the wind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Soon, the first gangs appeared. They promised safety as long as they were stronger and fiercer than their competitors. The individual was a helpless victim of their violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">One man led the people back to the path of righteousness. He called himself “the Judge”. He first appeared in 2381 in a small, fortified village close to the ruins of Bochum. There he apprehended a Clanner who had been wounded and left behind after a raid. He recited his crimes, theft being the smallest among them, and led him to the executioner’s block, an upturned iron bucket. The Judge fixed the delinquent’s head to the tin with his foot and smashed his head with one blow of his sledgehammer. There was no axe to be found in the village. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The onlookers were shocked. </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Yes, they had savored the captive’s fear of death after the suffering he had brought upon the village. But did it have to be so brutal? The Judge remained impassive. He adjusted his broadrimmed floppy hat, looked down the greasy hem of his cowhide coat spattered with blood, brain matter, and pieces of bone, and asked for a bowl of water. The hammer he offered back to the farmer who had lent it to him, but the man only shook his head. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">From now on, the villagers saw the Judge more often. He journeyed from settlement to settlement. With the patience of a snake waiting for its prey he mediated altercations between villagers and took on the work he was known and feared for: he judged. Whenever he arrived the villagers already awaited him with prisoners and told him about their crimes. His judgments were merciless, but just, his executions brutal and grim. His trademark floppy hat, the glasses, the coat and hammer were all soon known throughout West Borca. He was a figure of law, order, and deterrence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">He became a living legend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Judge cut a bloody swath through the landscape of Clans and outlaws. They resisted. They ambushed him, attacked him with two, three and finally four people. Hundreds of times the Judge went down, dragged from his horse, shot and kicked. But he was cunning and tough, kept getting up again, smashed stupidly gawking faces with his hammer, broke shins and rammed the heft into innards and eyes. He always won. His aura of righteous revenge finally started attracting young, enthusiastic people. At first they nourished him, warned him, and brought him information. In the end, they joined him, followed him and protected him on his crusade against all the scum.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>STONE HEADS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">It is a tradition amongst the Judges to immure a Supreme Judge’s mortal remains together with the Codex he wrote in a giant stone head built taller than a man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">23 of these monuments are lined up along the Judgement Alley in Justitian, looking gravely down onto a new generation of Judges.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>GUARDIANS OF ORDER</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soon, he had over 100 followers.

The Judges’ reputed ability to put up a fight should be enough to keep lawless rabble away.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>They all accepted, fortified the wells that the Chroniclers had kept hidden so far and expanded the old buildings. But not all of them were happy. To the Advocates, as the theorists were called now, the stone holds offered everything they needed for their studies of texts and their proliferation. To the old-fashioned Judges who wanted to beat the word of law into the faces of fat criminals with an iron fist, the Protectors, the nascent city was a corset hindering their movement. They made the best of it, even if they disliked the centralization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The city prospered and grew and was called Justitian, in honor of Justitia, the goddess of justice – another Chronicler idea. They were part of everything, crept into meetings and counseled without being asked. Due to their influence, one Judge arose and made a bid for power. Justus I was the first in the long tradition of Supreme Judges of Justitian. He elevated his own version of the Testament to a universally valid law and called it “the Codex”. He ordered the Advocates to make laws and asked the Protectors to apply them in the field. To each his own. Internal strife he countered with a hierarchy making clear who was right in the end. From now on, lesser and higher Judges rode through the city, and Vagrants and Enforcers guarded the gates. The groundwork was laid. Now it was time to build a monument upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Years later, the Judges ruled over the majority of West Borca. Settlements and farms joined the Justitian Protectorate. Give up independence for safety, maybe even leadership. After decades of fighting for survival, it was an easy choice for most people.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE CODEX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Every Supreme Judge enters into office with his own Codex. Time moves on, and the outlaws’ imagination seems endless. Beyond the Testament’s clear, fundamental rules, there is a need for clarification which has often caused aggravation in recent years. The text is fairly close to the people, it is something like a contract between the inhabitants of Justitian and the Judges. At least this is how it was in the beginning. For the Codex evolves, amended by the Advocates’ interpretations. The longer a Supreme Judge is in office, the more complex and tight the web of paragraphs becomes. Archot is the oldest of them all. He has been Supreme Judge for more than 20 years, and his Codex has become a bloated monster that no one can control anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Basic commandments like “Thou shalt not kill” and “Thou shalt not steal” form the smallest, but oldest part of the Codex. The subsidiary paragraphs list pages and pages of exceptions and measures of punishment. Then come the rules concerning strife of any kind, taken from an enormous measure of precedence cases: adultery, fraud, imposture, malpractice and much more – every eventuality is covered by paragraphs. The outside world clauses describe procedure outside the city in great detail, defining the rights and dues of Judges and people foreign to the Protectorate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">While the Advocates devise new laws in their palaces and keep an army of scribes occupied with a flood of amendments to the Codex, the Protectors out in the streets of Justitian face a dark future. Only a few older ones remember the times when the handy booklet wrapped in black leather gave them direction, but did not force them to rush down the slope like a train on brakeless tracks. There is no room for interpretation anymore. Everything that could be interpreted has been interpreted and set in stone.

Bringing the law to the people was challenging enough: the people have to understand the laws to accept the Codex, so the Protectors thought. The Advocates, on the other hand, see their position threatened. If the people understand and internalize the laws, what would they need the Judges for? This conflict between Protectors and Advocates is as old as the Cult itself and has always been a subject of discussion in Justitian’s Senates. So far, the Senates have been canceling each other out: traditionally, the Supreme Judge is the one to bring about a decision by voting.</span></p>\n<br />Some Latin words have managed to wiggle their way into the Judges’ language: for example, the Supreme Judge is often called “Primus inter pares”, first among peers. The trial is being held “Coram publico”, in public, the defendants are called into the stand with the phrase “Audiatur et altera pars!” (The other side shall be heard too!), and Protectors get in the right mood for the coming battle with “Per Aspera ad Astra” (through hardships, to the stars). Many a Judge finishes his final sentence with “Punctum!” (That’s it!) or starts a death sentence with “Mors certa, hora incerta.” (Death is certain, its hour is uncertain), and almost every second sentence of the opinion of the court can be spiced up by a “De iure” (by right). <br /><br />Some Judges would feel naked if they didn’t wear this garb of unintelligible phrases. Others completely refrain from using the Latin clichés. As far as the Cult is concerned, that is up to the Judges alone.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>JURYMEN</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Protectorate thrives and grows quicker than the number of its Judges.

Mostly, they choose enclave leaders or merchants with a good reputation, less often decorated veterans who are schooled as Jurymen in a fast-track procedure. They can pass Judgements in the absence of Judges and arrest culprits until the Judge can review their case. If a culprit accepts the temporary Judgment, it becomes valid and irreversible. Lesser punishments like the marking of a thief or liar are implemented at once by a Juryman or his representative. In more severe cases, a Protector must be consulted.<br /></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AN EYE FOR AN EYE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Judges bring law to the wasteland, and just like a strict father teaches the rules of life to his unruly kids by beating them, the Judges punish all who act against the Codex’s teachings. Punishment is not an end in itself, but a tool to frighten the masses and lead them on the path to purity, so the First Judge writes in his journal.</span></p>\n<br />Thus, the Judges have developed many forms of reproof, castigation, and harsh punishments for every crime during the long years of their existence. They know no imprisonment, though. Justitian was not willing to shoulder the cost for arresting and feeding a prisoner for days or even months. <br /><br />The Judges’ penal system also needs to take into account that the people in the Protectorate are practically anonymous. No one has ever heard of passports or birth certificates. If you move house within Justitian, you can start a new life as a stranger in the new neighborhood. The Judges counteracted this by making punishments visible. For example, a thief’s hands and forearms are dyed blue using a stinking solution. The same color is used to mark the lips of liars and frauds. Depending on the mixture, this color takes weeks or months to fade. The culprits then get rid of the social anathema and get a second chance. Repeat offenders who are still marked are treated more harshly by the Judges and soon feel the iron fist of Justitian’s justice. Thieves have one knuckle on each hand smashed, frauds get their tongue split with a glowing blade. They should have taken the admonition to heart. <br /><br />Killers and rapists do not get a second chance. Their forehead is branded using a Judgment iron, and they are banned from the Protectorate. Should they return to be arrested, the Judges leave it to the victims or their relatives to choose the punishment. Popular forms of punishment are smashing a limb with the Judgment hammer or tearing it out using the Judge’s horse. In especially severe cases, there is a death sentence and the culprit is killed by a heavy blow to the head. <br /><br />Many culprits, especially those guilty of lesser crimes, get to choose. Either pay an indemnification to their victims or spend a few days in Justitian’s labour camps. Additionally, their faces are marked with red color, the henna. In the following days, they work for the city’s benefit, repair streets, build houses, shovel dirt from the Defiler Streets, fight the dust with their spades, and work on the great Colossus, Chairman Archot’s legacy. If one of them flees and gets caught, he must expect severe repercussions. If the Judges showed mercy, it would be considered weakness. That is something they cannot allow if they want to keep controlling their army of forced laborers. They will treat him like a felon. Only when the henna fades away after two or three weeks may the prisoner go unmolested. A few even stay. Two meals a day are more than they could manage in their normal lives. <br /><br />The Judges’ punishments shape Justitian’s culture. A deal is always sealed by a handshake, before which merchant and customer take off their gloves or wrappings, making sure that the other has no marked skin before getting down to business. Those who wear their gloves on a market in Justitian must expect to be eyed warily. “Show me your hands” is a familiar saying. The same is true for the face. It is considered impolite to hide your face under scarf or breathing mask while in conversation. Why would you do that if not to hide the fact that you are a liar or a fraud? Showing your face is considered tantamount to honesty. Thus, strangers who do not know Justitian’s ways often have a hard time getting started in the Protectorate.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ADVOCATES: CODEX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>BOOK⏵</p>\n<p>TIMELINE⏵</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nThe drill in the dust, the shouting when fighting with the hammers and the eternal din from the Protectors’ sealing block – all this is a permanent nuisance to the Advocates.

A few shots from the rifle, jumping for cover, yes, that’ll do. But they know no leniency concerning the knowledge about the Codex.

The last trial is held in the Senate Hall. Extras step up and describe fictional problems, others play the roles of culprits, victims and witnesses. The applicant walks amongst the extras, questioning them and forming an opinion. If his Judgement satisfies the tribunal, he’s almost there. In front of the tribunal, the Judge swears an oath on the Codex and on Justitian, just like the Protectors when they are sworn in. But he will not need his hammer here.

At least, this is what the historians will write. Without using force, his Judges annexed dozens of the villages and erected their Judgement stones all over Borca. The Clans died in the hail of lead from the Judges’ muskets. The Cockroach Clan, savage and bestial as it was, crawled back between the crevices, never to be seen again. The smugglers’ nest called Ignatz was razed in a concerted punitive expedition together with the Preservists. The Judges advanced on all fronts, smashing and rebuilding. Archot himself knew of his magnificence and consciously hid under an insufficient layer of false humility.</span></p>\n<br />If the rumors in the Senate can be believed, Archot feared nothing more than to be forgotten after his death. According to tradition, a stone head would be erected for him next to the Judgement Alley – and thus, he would just be one of a long line of Supreme Judges. It is said he couldn’t stand this notion – and so, it began. He gathered his Advocates and issued a new edict. For his fire to inspire those who came after him, a mausoleum that did his achievements justice should be built for him. The prisoners in the boot camps had a new job. They struggled in the ruins, harvested stones, and dragged them to Justitian’s Uptown. They piled them up at the end of the Judgement Alley: layer by layer, a stone torso formed, passing from a sinewy neck to the chin, tapering at the shoulders. <br /><br />The Colossus towered 30 feet high when a Jehammedan assassin blew it up. <br /><br />More than just a pile of stones were destroyed that day: Archot’s soul crumbled. Someone had to pay. There were witnesses to the attack. A Chronicler Sensorium registered the Hagari shortly before the detonation. The overseers at the Colossus had also seen a female Jehammedan. Archot got word of these facts less than 30 minutes after the attack. He also knew that the Osmani had sent an Isaaki, one of their blessed children, to Justitian. Archot stood on the steps of the Hall of Judgement in his flowing robes, his white hair in disarray and his eyes dark with sadness and hard with fury. “Hang him!” <br /><br />Streamers spread out, trying to warn the Jehammedan community, but they did not reach them. Interface lag. In the end, Rutgar’s Black Judges found the Isaaki, Gideon, and riddled him with 12 rounds of lead. His horse carried him on for more than 50 steps before the corpse slid from the saddle and hit the pavement.<br /><br />Archot decided to hang the Isaaki on a jib a on the Uptown wall. Fodder for the crows and, of course, a sign of his disapproval. <br /><br />An era of strength ended, and Archot’s madness would define the next.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>RETREAT</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Jehammedan Quarter survived, mainly due to the Iconide Baruch who demanded the family council turn their backs on Osman.

The three main entrances with their zigzag friezes cut deep into its front, which open out onto the Judgement Alley. Between them, two colossal bronze statues in Judges’ robes tower eight meters high: one is leaning on a hammer, the other presses a dusty image of the Codex to its chest. Their cool gaze rests on the ruin of the Colossus at the end of the Avenue. The Hall of Judgement is rectangular, 80 m long and 50 m wide, a fortress with thick walls and pillars carrying the weight of the inner dome. High, arched windows with artistic glass paintings symbolizing the Judges’ virtues on one side and the outlaws’ deadly sins on the other break up the buildings angular form. The roof is 14 m high, a broad battlement with low bunker towers on all four corners surrounding the whole building. Thick-bellied cannons and mortar mounts stare down onto visitors grimly from above. Behind them, the Protectors patrol.</span></p>\n<br />A one-story concrete building covered in ashlar from pre-Eshaton times clings to the shadowy north flank. Here, the Judges’ horses are stabled. It is said they are better off than some of Justitian’s citizens. In the Hall of Judgement, actually consisting of several vaults, there is a sacral mood. The stained-glass windows break the light into a display of blue, red, and green colored panes. Judges and Chroniclers walk in and out of here all the time: the most important offices can be found in the south wing. The center opens up onto an atrium surrounded by a cloister. Here, Protectors and Advocates meet for friendly discussions. In the main hall, the Supreme Judge resides. In the adjoining side wings, the Senates meet.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE CODEX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">SERVE JUSTICE, </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">SEEK THAT WHICH IS WRONG, </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">THE WORD </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">GIVES US PREMONITION AND SHOWS US THE WAY. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT AWAKENS THE SPIRIT, </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">EXACTS THE CONSCIOUSNESS. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">T</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">HE HAMMER </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">DOES NOT SHOW THE WAY. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT PUNISHES. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT EXORCISES. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT REMOVES. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">CLOAK AND HAT ARE THE SIGNS OF THE COMMUNITY OF THE RIGHTEOUS. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">THEY DEMAND HUMILITY </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">AND ASK FOR RESPECT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">GOGGLES AND SCARF </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ARE THE SHADOW </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">HIDING THE FEAR AND </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">DEFLECTING REVENGE. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">THE MUSKET </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IS LIGHT AND LIGHTNING. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ALL THAT IS FALSE FLEES FROM IT </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">INTO RUIN.<br /></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE BARRACKS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">At strategic points in Justitian, the Judges have erected barracks.

That was such an old word. In the meantime, they lived. They had left the dark so far behind. Those from Toulon now considered themselves Touloni, a family with a long tradition working as smiths called itself the Steel Masters, a Clan that was harvesting stones in the ruins called itself the Masons.

Then, they settled close to the fields. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The wheat was highly resistant and undemanding, thriving in the cold close to the Ice Barrier just as well as in Pollen’s dry climate. The Spitalians tried to analyze the strain and found similarities to the Bygone Triticale, but nothing conclusive. The Rain wheat was something special, something new. They didn’t like that. For it could only mean that it was a Primer aberration, and almost everyone was eating it. However, all tests proved that even though spores could afflict Triticale its basic form was spore-free.

It can only be found where Judges or Hellvetics have tread paths in the dust. Beyond them, in the unexplored territories, anything is possible. For centuries, Clans whose grasp of humanity has suffered dearly through ongoing incest have been living in the shadows of civilisation. For the Spitalians, these wild Clans could make an interesting field of research, for they still retain some Bygone blood undiluted by inbreeding with a large gene pool for generations.</p>\n<p>However, these savages do not cooperate.</p>\n<p>Instead, they are very dangerous. Their Shamans, Chieftains, or Founders are hulking figures who can unite the whole incestuous Clan into one group bristling with weapons with one shout. They kill anyone who approaches them and devour the bodies. They are like animals, greedy and wild, unfettered by any cultural values. They sleep with rats, snarl at Gendos, and determine their ranks through bloody battles. They are not good neighbors. When they are hungry and leave their valleys, the good settlers bar their huts, call for the Anabaptists and grab their spears. None shall escape!</p>\n<p>The settlers’ outlook is biased by centuries of conflict. Every Clan knows its own stories of cannibals, screaming savages whose skin is painted white with dirt and who carry glass daggers. The savages broke into huts, slashed women’s faces and throats and stole children. The elders still weep when they talk about the village warriors’ retribution and how they found only bloodstained spits next to burned campfires and gnawed bones. No one begrudges them a certain distrust towards strangers.</p>\n<p>Only very few of the savages are cannibals, though. They are all marked by their distance from the large civilizations. Some have lived for centuries unmolested by Judges and Spitalians, having seen nothing but their valley’s steep slopes and their ancestors’ bunkers. They were happy with the isolation. However, others watched the large cities’ sea of lights and smoking chimneys from the hills, pressed tightly to the ground. They were afraid. The people down there were aggressive and too quick to draw their weapons. Their language was gibberish, they usually shouted strange words as they waved their pointy metal sticks and their fire-throwers in their direction. The savages retreated to convene and wait. Only great need or great injustice would turn their fear into hatred. Then not even the greatest of cities would be safe anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>POWER AND INFLUENCE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Anabaptists started out as a small group of faithful gathered around the alleged Messiah called Rebus.

At the same time, the Anabaptists’ aqueducts crisscross wide areas, speaking of Cathedral City’s dignity and benevolence. In the Alpine foothills, the Hellvetics have dug in, guarding the trade routes as they have for ages. The Clans ruled by these Cults have tolerated the paternalism for a long time. The Judges and Anabaptists chased all the scum from their territory to a place where no hails of lead and no walls of blades awaited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Before, those who fancied themselves dressed in Justitian fashion took hand-rolled medicine globules and thanked Rebus the Baptist for every healthy downpour. The people looked upon their settlements with pride, saw themselves as Ferropolites, Earfielders, Leadfielders, Liquans. The young ones pined for Justitian, dreaming of being legal citizens of this vibrant metropolis. They scratched lichens from the Judgement stones and brought a soup made of boiled roots to their local Judges on a daily basis until the fat and lazy Judges walked next to their mares because they couldn’t mount them anymore. They listened to the Judges’ breathless accounts of giant battles against the Cockroach Clan and heard them scoff about the foolish Exalters who still drank water from their poisoned wells. They even laughed at the bad jokes. They did not listen to their elders anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Now, something is stirring. The Cockroaches never disappeared. They only fled deeper into the Bygone tunnels. They lurk again in the shadows of the seas of debris, attacking as swift as lightning only to disappear back into the underground with their prey. The Exalters confront Justitian as they did before. The Chroniclers had to use their full repertoire of infamy and underhanded tactics to keep the Enemoi Clan away from ancient stores of knowledge, but suddenly the Judges are tied up in the battle against the Cockroaches and harshly sweep aside the technology-obsessed Cult’s pleas for help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Praha’s fall does the rest. The Clans and kinsmen remember their roots, find their way back to their old pride. The elders’ words are listened to once again. They have never needed Justitian, and they never will. Revenge is such an ugly word, such an uncivilized feeling. Even so, just look at those complacent blubberbutts with their dusty waistcoats and floppy hats… </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Hellvetics had not fared much better. The Clans in the cantons rose up, raged against their former compulsory allies in neighboring cities, and lost themselves in endless trade wars. Hellvetica watched this for years. Couldn’t the people have marched into a blessed future thankfully – and more importantly, together? Would that have been so difficult? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Commanders of the Territorial Region convened. They had seen enough. There was no need for discussion anymore. They called their soldiers back into the mountain, leaving the thankless bunch to reality. Reality was happy to oblige, for it had always been lurking at the fringe of perception on snow-covered peaks and passes. Like an avalanche, it hit the lowlands in the shape of the hordes of expelled valley Clans and mountain tribes. The people in the Swiss heartland had to fight for their homes for the first time, forced to arm themselves with pointed spears instead of harsh words. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The cities hate each other and have largely turned into military camps. However, they do not attack each other. While the citizens of Bern, Lyss, and Worb are united by a tradition of animosity, the enmity towards other cantons runs much deeper. However, the savages from the mountains are even worse. Maybe they all have more in common than they care to admit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Beyond the Reaper’s Blow in East Borca, the shockwaves rushing outwards from Praha’s fall can be felt much more strongly. Nomads still roam the conifer forests and follow the giant herds on their north-south route. However, large Clans are moving towards Praha from the north. Everyone wants to see the city that has been hidden from the public eye for so long, and once they are there, they might as well just grab something as a recompense for the long journey. There have been non-stop skirmishes and full-blown family feuds tearing apart the land ever since the city’s fall: Praha seems to have become much more dangerous.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> For a long time, Osman was considered untouchable. The Jehammedans stuck together and tilled the land wisely and justly. The farming Clans had no reason to complain. The unrest now comes from another direction. Over the centuries, the Osmani had an army of foreigners, the Janites, that now consists of hundreds of militarized Clans. They ride out every day to cull the savages in the area in bloody skirmishes. They die for Osman, giving their lives in the grim knowledge that by doing so, they buy a place in the Janites’ ranks for their children. However, the Iconides mistrust them. Praha has taught them a lesson.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>FRANKA</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Frankan Clans live far away from large Pheromancer strongholds like Souffrance. Many families returned home years after the Eshaton to rebuild what was rightfully theirs. Those estates in the overgrown or swamped ruins are now several centuries old. Many of the venerable buildings are still in good repair, but others look more like a cavern. The floors have collapsed under the weight of time, and ivy and grass cover the cavities. The Clanners make the best of it. They fight the humidity with campfires, cut down the brush, and live on fish and damp grasses. All of them can survive in the swamps with nothing but a spear. They use lakes and rivers to hide from swarm and Pheromancer alike. Some Frankan Clans have retreated to the rivers. They live on rafts or boats tied together and watch the Aberrants’ movements from a safe distance. They do not need to fear ant swarms or the storms of wasps. It seems that perhaps pheromone markers cannot travel through the air over running water.</p>\n<p>Few Clans stay clear from the conflict with the Pheromancers. Fewer even have this option. Those who still can fight the intruders – anointed with Marduk oil they creep into the Ziggurats and breeding chambers to destroy the Queens or blow up the methane vents. The Spital helps them by getting EX, other drugs, and detonation cartridges into the frontier settlements. Smuggler Clans transport them inland.</p>\n<p>In Briton, the situation is desperate. The Anabaptists’ and Spitalians’ supply trains are not coming in, so they lack food and personnel, while termites are busy building vent after vent. The doctors have been training Clans who have lost their homes to the Pheromancers as deputy Spitalians. They carry Splayers salvaged from the bodies of fallen Famulancers’ and are given bag-like gas masks from local stores, for which they are called “Grenouilles”: frogs. They see their home trembling under masses of insects, watch the vents growing on their territory. No one fights harder than they do.</p>\n<p>The gases heavy with pheromones drift to the northeast, into the Stukov. They cover the desert, sink in, and change. Under the salt crust, new life grows – the engine of evolution starts. Here, the Clans eat Dust Worms and Desert Clams, creatures the Spitalian probably wouldn’t find even in their textbooks. Their hunters are as implacable as the climate, but still they deal with the Spitalians, exchanging Flying Leeches, Stukov Scorpions, Rift Centipedes, and Husk Spiders for drugs and weapons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>POLLEN</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The constant change of the environment, the withering tundra, the ever-present gossamer, and the cold all force the Pollners into eternal wanderings. Wherever they stop, they fight the ground for food: they catch insects in pits, they scratch mosses from rocks, or they dig roots from the ground. Anything that can be cooked is edible.</p>\n<p>However, for some years now, the land has been changing. The rock underfoot trembles, snow is melting in circular formations, the ground is feverishly hot. Spore fields rot, replaced by gaudy green vegetation growing along fractal paths. Fruit hangs fully and seductively from the trees of this awakening paradise. Danger lurks, though: One tiny scratch and they burst and cover the plucking hand with a hot, grainy sap. Some Clans go looking for those Fractal Forests. They harvest the fruit and sell it to the Anabaptists’ emissaries at the Alpine passage of Ternitz.</p>\n<p>The Apocalyptics have witnessed this game long enough now. Pollen has always been the Mother of Raven’s pasture, and she cannot remember having given a concession to these Clans. Strictly speaking, she has never given a concession to anyone. But what does that matter? The migratory birds are gathering. When they come across a Clan in the Fractal Forests, they descend upon it like a murder of hungry crows. However, the Pollners have been stoically chewing lichens for centuries, have defied the cold, the Spore Beasts, and the Biokinetics, and they do not plan to run. War cries echo from the woods – the battle between primal and trained brutality has just begun.</p>\n<p>The Spitalians are somewhere in between. Their Preservists burn down the Fractal Forests wherever they can find them, decrying them as a strange Primer function. Neither the Clans nor the Apocalyptics can tolerate this.</p>\n<p>Although the Ice Barrier devours several feet of land every day, some Clans have survived up north. None of them consist of more than 30 people today, but they likely all come from a Clan shattered some 300 years ago. Indicative of that fact, they all wait for the Horse Oracle, an enigmatic three-faced figure, to arrive. They hunt and dig for old stores abandoned by their ancestors. The Westja Clan is extraordinarily good at that, and the Clan actively trades with the Spitalians in snow-laden Danzig.</p>\n<p>Resident Clans are rare in Pollen. The largest Clan is the Wroclaw confederation, led by the Piast and his Druschinniks. Dozens of Clans had to bend their knees to him in order to enter the inner ring within the city walls and profit from his Eternal Oasis. The Africans are using Wroclaw as a starting point on their hunt for Biokinetics and have stationed a Surge Tank next to the entrance as a show of good will and trust, so the city is considered unassailable. Still, Praha’s fall terrified the Wroclaw Clans.

They never liked the fact that strangers make trouble in their land. Spitalians blew up Dushani rock formations and thus brought screaming madness to whole provinces. The Jehammedans drove families away from their land and into their war against the Africans, armed only with hope and a rake. Palers milked villages until their inhabitants fled into the Voivodes’ arms, gaunt and wearing nothing but rags. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This stops now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">It began in Sofia, over two winters before the fall of Praha. A nameless man joined Voivode Wiktor’s henchmen, fighting his way to the top, and became his right-hand man. On the streets, the people bowed to him. When he reached the end of the career ladder, he asked Wiktor for a meeting. They ate together, and after the meal, the man approached his Voivode, embraced him, kissed him, and broke his neck. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">From this day on, he called himself Karakhan, the black leader. The Balkhani laughed about the boisterous name. However, they soon learned that sometimes a name carries a message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Karakhan was a sensitive tactician. Within one year he had chased the Spitalians from Sofia, smoked out the surrounding bunkers, and made even the Jehammedans swear loyalty to him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Now, Karakhan and two other Voivoide Clans rule Eastern Balkhan with an iron fist. The Cults have become supplicants who must justify their every step to the Voivodes. Those who do not obey are sold into African slavery – a fact that has curbed the conflict between Balkhani and Africans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Secluded from the eternal power struggles, there are still Clans living in the mountains: cranky, frugal people distilling their own Slivovitz, living in quarry stone houses, and welcoming every stranger as long as he shows respect. However, there is no peace here, either. Some of those Clans have been warring for centuries. One wrong word or a wrong name uttered in a merry circle, and the mood changes abruptly.

The Clans are just as old, and all insist on their counterparts knowing this. They cultivate their family trees and carefully mark the branches the African invaders hacked off – the people of conquerors bearing the counterattack with stoicism. The wind of pride blows through their castles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">However, many of the ancestral homes are empty, and even in the inhabited ones dust settles in many rooms. Again, the Iconides have incited the young ones with bluster and insinuation. “Do you know what the Scourgers do to your women? They take the children by the legs and smash them against the tree, so for them, it is over quickly. But the women…” No one can elude this without soiling the family honor. Young men and women march south at the side of the Swords of Jehammed to confront the invaders. For months, the fighters live in the jungle, setting traps, lurking, attacking, and retreating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Over the decades, their tactics barely changed – until the Warpage arose and devoured Clans and Scourger units alike. Now, there are new rules, ones that do not necessarily help the Guerreros. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">When the fighters attack the Scourger emplacements in the south, they have no room to retreat – the Warpage is at their backs, pushing them on. Only the bravest and craziest dare to go deep enough into this Pregnoctic phenomenon to shake off pursuers. The Jehammedans do not care. Those with faith in their hearts will find a way. They keep whipping up the Clans and driving them south. Should they give up their motherland that easily? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Some say yes. They live in the Warpage, unknown to Scourgers and Jehammedans alike. On the high plateau they have been erased from the chronicles, considered lost. It is almost true.

Creatures with needle maws beset by ticks and lice scuttle through the force fields. Suddenly, they open their blind eyes wide. War cries and the sound of horns greet them. People with swords and Spitfires come racing towards them, their eyes hot with Elysian fire. The final battle has begun, and Purgare is the battlefield. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This is not about emanations or faith anymore: The Psychokinetics are no abstract threat to tell stories about around the campfire, everyone laughing heartily afterwards. No. The Aberrants breed behind the Apennines’ mountain ranges. Night would have long since conquered Purgare if the Anabaptists did not give their lives on a daily basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Family after family has joined the Anabaptists, and the largest ones have divided Purgare amongst themselves. They aid the Orgiastics with scouts or give the basic means of life to their hordes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Even if most of the Purgan families firmly back the Anabaptists, they have conserved their internal strife and struggles. They believe in honor and land. One disrespectful word could lead to a fight that starts a circle of revenge and counter-revenge. The heads of the families may stop these feuds via decree – as long as they can keep face doing so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">However, there are deviants, too. Those who do not cooperate with the Anabaptists are pushed to the fringes of society – and off the inhabited areas. The few independents retreat to the Apennines or take a chance in Western Purgare’s sulfuric deserts. They keep their distance from the Nox Crater, but they do not fear single Psychokinetics. Every family member knows what to do when encountering one: the younger children act as bait, the older ones determine the size of the force fields and Filaments with sticks, some light fires to chase away the swarms of fleas, while others hack their way to the epicenter and kill the Psychokinetic. Anabaptists unwilling to return to their camp without a prize are more than willing to buy the Aberrants’ heads.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AFRICA</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The African Clans look back on a rich tradition. They are completely self-contained and live a life remembering their ancestors, far away from the coastal and oil settlements. They sacrifice milk and honey at rocks and trees to pacify the spirits, and they treat their white slaves well – nourishing food and a strict hand are enough.</p>\n<p>However, the cities beckon with gaudy fun and adventure. Day by day, the tribes lose their young adults to melting pots like Tripol. The Psychovores get the rest. The elders resist. They involve the young people more strongly, let them lead the hunt, give them whites to beat, or concubines to enjoy. Old rules are re-interpreted and defended against the coca-intoxicated elders.</p>\n<p>However, even one dead sparrow hawk on the village square can be considered a bad omen and thus destroy any progress, lead a Clan back to its old ways, and ossify in tradition. However, the loss of the young is not the only danger. The Psychovores spread and steal habitats from humans. Scouts report that the Psychovores make room for humans even deep in the jungle. Giant circular areas rot within hours – but who can tell if this vesicular decay is not merely part of the circle of life? Who knows what the next cycle may bring?</p>\n<p>Some Clans have the courage to settle amidst the strange vegetation. They move on when the circle is closed.</p>\n<p>Some keep going further south. No one ever hears from them again. Those who stick to the growth line can harvest Psychovore seeds and fruit that earn some good Dinars from the Scourgers.</p>\n<p>Still, Clans organize a resistance. They burn down the Psychovore stolons and salt the burnt areas. The Spitalians who now reside in Qabis, examining the Psychovore wall’s route, think this is a bad idea. The Psychovores act like an organism, wincing when in pain but growing all the faster elsewhere, developing strategies, adapting. Every single area is freed at a high cost.

Too often, that leads to greed.</p>\n<p>The Scrappers come in flocks to bring them their findings. Almost none of them really know what the artifacts are truly worth. It makes little to no sense to discuss this with the Chroniclers, for at the first sign of discussion or haggling they will suddenly lose interest, raise their pinky and rattle a brief “Exit! Exit!” from their Vocoders. The Scrappers have to take what they get. Supposedly they can get more whenever the Scrapper Cartel’s Appraisers are involved, but who knows for sure?</p>\n<p>Actually, the Chroniclers have made an art form out of evaluating an artifact: they examine it from all sides, plugging in diagnosis gear or using one of their crackling boxes on it. The artifact check can take an instant or minutes – but that has no effect on the price. As payment, the Scrappers get information on Bygone artifact stores (the Chroniclers call this “recursive information trade”) or Chronicler Drafts. The Scrappers accept, sometimes grudgingly, sometimes euphorically. It doesn’t matter to the Chroniclers, they’ll always return anyway.</p>\n<p>What the Chroniclers are to European Scrappers, the Neolibyans are to African ones. The Magnates’ Surge Tanks can hold tons of scrap: artifacts are cleaned and improved, metal is melted and cast into trusses and armor plates for new Surge Tanks. But if you offer an amount of Chronicler Drafts that a Borcan would kill for to an African, he will spit at best.

A steel rod a villager could use to support his hut or to bash in an attacker’s skull was worth more than one of the legendary thinking machines. However, the Europeans never gave up completely on the artifacts: the memory of the Bygones was supported by their gear, and where there was a will, there potentially was a way, too.</p>\n<p>The worship produced strange effects. Clans propagated stories of the relics’ inherent magic, accumulated scrap for their own tribes, and prayed to it – with negligible effects. Others banned the artifacts as a symbol of exaggerated materialism that must have driven any divinity from the Bygone people’s lives. Naturally, the two groups didn’t get along very well.</p>\n<p>The Scrappers were in the midst of it all, the piece of iron between anvil and hammer.</p>\n<p>However, better times were to come.</p>\n<p>In Borca, the Judges conjured a hail of lead and drove the sects from their Protectorate, while the Chroniclers built Alcoves and even showed interest in those platinum fragments that had been worn as jewelry on a necklace before.

They develop a feeling for the ruins, learn to interpret them. Who lived here once? How did they fare? And especially: did they survive the Eshaton and take their treasures with them? In a weird way, most Scrappers feel at home in the ruins. No unnecessary talk, no maneuvering, no misunderstandings caused by thoughtless compliments. Life is so simple out there. Sure, you have to watch out for the Gendos, and there isn’t always fresh water, and there’s little hope of good food, but even so, the ruins are a home to them that they won’t leave until their dying breath. A few deviate from this path of scavenging. They become Mechanists, creating true marvels from scrap: many legendary rifles, traps, and highly complex clockwork devices and locks have been built in their workshops. The Chroniclers are suspicious of this development.

Almost every Scrapper knows simple line symbols of his own design that can be easily scratched into walls with a knife. Many Scrappers have their name sign tattooed onto their forehead or the back of their hand as a mark of their individuality. Once they have searched a ruin, they mark it with a sign: “Was here.

West Borca is a repository, bringing to the scene a whole army of Scrappers. Finding an untouched spot here borders on a miracle. Here, the Cartel, a community of Scrappers, has been flourishing for some years. Or rather that’s what Bosch, its leader, calls it with a wry smile. He is an irritable dwarf trying to leash the Black Lung’s Scrappers in order to extort higher prices from the Chroniclers. His bullies monitor the ruins and sell search licenses while his Appraisers offer their services to laden Scrappers in front of the exchange Alcoves – by force, if necessary. But his network has holes, and many Scrappers manage to bypass the Cartel. Even so, the organization is growing stronger by the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Beyond the Reaper’s Blow, Bosch’s influence fades. Over there, the rules are different anyway. Nature takes back the seas of debris, and the superstitious nomads consider them cursed: they steer clear of the rugged rows of walls. In the last decades, some Scrappers from West Borca found their way into the wide conifer forests and settled there. Wherever they set foot, they dig artifacts from the forest floor. But the next Chroniclers are hundreds of days’ marches away – beyond a volcanically active fault that you can only circumvent via the Hellvetics’ fortress. This is no fun. Luckily, there are the renegade Needle Tower Chroniclers. The Cluster buzzes with agitation when anyone mentions them. Those who trade with the Needles are banned for life by the Chroniclers. Of course, the Chroniclers don’t tell anybody how they find out who has dared to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Needle Towers aren’t the only ones who sometimes buy baubles.

Their urges open up a land of lust and satisfaction waiting to be explored and exploited. Yesterday and tomorrow are endlessly far away – foreign lands that only stinking old men rave about. What makes an Apocalyptic’s soul shiver is the caress of a perfumed woman or a strong man, cries of passion and of pain, cold power. Bookish knowledge makes them, and one very important part of the body, shrink back.</p>\n<p>The Cult’s roots, though, seem forgotten. What good were they for the Apocalyptics anyway? Should they have learned from them?</p>\n<p>Chroniclers are known for dealing with fun and sexuality like Spitalians do with Psychonauts. Beyond normal life, this gives them a lot of time to sniff around in other people’s affairs. The Cluster has evaluated hundreds of thousands of Stream extracts related to the Apocalyptics over the centuries and added findings of Streamers and Mediators to them. What’s interesting is that they found an inherent structure in this trove of data. Information clustered around blank spots, joining to form a giant puzzle that had to be expanded several times and finally was transferred into an n-dimensional data space. Click! Every day, new data comes in, sticking to the structures or strengthening existing links. The silhouettes of the black spots are higher in contrast than ever before, mocking the Chroniclers and keeping them going until, yes, until … Yes!</p>\n<p>In the beginning, there was Gerome Getrell.</p>\n<p>He was a billionaire, visionary, brilliant orator, and televangelist. He preached the power of the archetypes and of the Tarot, free love and sadism, nationalism and anarchy, democracy and dictatorship, a life on the fast lane, subversion. His Streamcasts made the data paths glow, illuminating the deepest recesses of the Bygone soul. One feed alone generated thousands of interpretations, most of which were founded on Getrell’s paradoxes. Everyone felt he was onto something, a feeling of insight. Getrell’s wisdom promised freedom in an overregulated world to those who were able to decipher the feeds and see the truth between the contradictions.</p>\n<p>Passion over mind was the simplest interpretation.</p>\n<p>Their proponents set forth to shock. They formed gangs that at first were only known for ecstatic parties and orgies, drug abuse, mass brawls, and storming public buildings – a nuisance, but not a danger that couldn’t be handled with truncheons and shockers.</p>\n<p>But the gangs grew, and so did their confidence and ruthlessness. With a fleet of captured drones, they cut a bloody swath through the ranks of established cartels to finally take over the drug market. They discovered prototype mobile factories and produced guns and metal blades for the masses in them. They avoided the security forces, but they didn’t hide. They were free as a bird, and when one of them was shot down, the Flock didn’t care. Wherever they appeared, they sprayed a stylized raven on the wall, the sign of Getrell’s Apocalyptics.</p>\n<p>Getrell never took a stance on this. He never referred to current events. He was above the fray.</p>\n<p>The tree of chaos he had planted continued to produce colorful blossoms, some of them poisonous, some of them wholesome. For there were peaceful offshoots as well: spiritual people who turned their backs on the established religions in disappointment and found inner strength in Getrell’s mystical Tarot.</p>\n<p>He disappeared a few months before the Eshaton. His Stream feeds kept hammering into his disciples’ skulls, but there were no updates. He didn’t tell them what the future held. Journalists looking for him got lost in the thicket of his corporations. He had to be somewhere in there.</p>\n<p>Here, the Chroniclers lose his track.</p>\n<p>His followers stepped up, dominating the Stream almost until it collapsed. At that time, the Apocalyptics were an outlet for many people. Really live just one last time, feel every nuance of your own suffering and joy…</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>FALSE PROPHET</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Streamfeed-Subject: Manipulation</p>\n<p>From: Ammit@hiddenhost</p>\n<p>To: *</p>\n<p>Gerome Getrell did not address you, your wife, your kids, or your neighbors.

They quickly conquered the black markets, placing intermediaries with the UEO soldiers monitoring the reconstruction. Through them, the Apocalyptics got their hands on food, weapons, and filtration systems and stashed them in the ruins. Those who got in the way were bribed, blackmailed, or killed.

When the bones ache, the skin gets wrinkled, and the eyes water in the harsh wind, an Apocalyptic’s time has come. A withered leaf has no place in a clearing full of gaudy flowers. But there is no acceptance for this. The old ones cling to life, gritting their rotten teeth and using powders and perfumes to hide the stench of decay. However, every gaze upon their rotting face by their younger siblings screams: GO! GO AWAY ALREADY! Yet the old ones don’t see that others avoid them at the campfires, they laugh with the others when they kick away their crutches and act jovial. <br /><br />No one needs parents. All an Apocalyptic needs is siblings to whirl out into the world or live out his need for intoxication with. The old ones only sit at home or hinder the Flock’s ventures. Oh, and all their wise-ass talk. The young ones lose their patience: they hate the ugly faces. They tell them one last time that they are unwanted. If the old ones don’t leave on their own accord, they are pushed from the nest. The fall is deep and deadly. <br /><br />Those who stay anyway and can win through this negative attitude must be cunning and dangerous. Such elders have made use of their years and now are lords over life and death, they are quick with the blade and are subtle schemers. To deny them respect is foolish. <br /><br />Usually, they act from behind the scenes and control an impressive syndicate. They trust nothing and no one – especially not their siblings. They would rather be accompanied by Hellvetics than by Battle Crows.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>CARRION BIRDS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Right after the Judges had founded the Protectorate, they came fluttering: the Carrion Birds. Some say they’d always been around. No one dares to doubt this. The Carrion Birds have their fingers deep in Justitian’s economy. They own the hottest bordellos, their champions are amongst the best pit fighters. Their Storks buy the children of poor Scrappers or farmers at dawn, teach them to pick pockets and to perform evasive maneuvers. Smuggling, slavery, assassinations – the Carrion Birds are in. They have always been led by a Raven, or more accurately: the Mother of Ravens. Since the era of the beast, a person of that name was the talk of the town. With her claws, she tore enemies’ throats out, full of anger. She was there when Exalt fell, took part in the City Wars and in Cultrin’s march. Generations of lovers became caught in her web and died after making love to her. She birthed whole tribes in the East: Ravens in the Balkhan, in Pollen, and in Borca have her blood in their veins. The incapable ones amongst her children she killed in their sleep, cooking and eating them so they returned to her womb – food for the next spawn already making her belly swell. But that was centuries ago. The Mother of Ravens nesting amidst her Flock like a haggard demon nowadays simply has to be someone else.

Hard work is for those dumb Anabaptists who sacrifice today for tomorrow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Apocalyptics’ reputation in the towns is thus divided. For Scrappers, the temples of lust and the inns are the only places to call home during their stay in the civilization. For a fair price, the migrants soften up a hard life with distillate, Burn, and love for sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Jehammedans usually are somewhat stricter. The migrants seduce people and thus drive a thorn into the Cult’s side that festers and leads to gangrene. Many a family was cast out and had its Icons smashed because their venerable Abramis or Saraelis succumbed to a Magpie’s charms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Anabaptists can deal with passion and excess as long as they come from a pure soul, but the Apocalyptics carry decay in their lungs and Burn buds in their pockets. Wherever they go, white flakes soon well up, sinking into stone and earth and calling out to the Demiurge’s spawn. That cannot be tolerated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The East Wind Flock got to feel the anger of the Cults. The Flock was deeply immersed in the Burn business: no bud reached the markets in the Protectorate that had not gone through their hands. Finally, the Spitalians sussed out the East Wind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Led by Dr. Heilkamp and the Office of Hygienics, they compiled dossiers on all Flock members. Heilkamp always knew where the Ravens were and what was stored in their warehouses. Then, the Great Purge followed. In a concerted action of Judges, Anabaptists, and Spitalians, all Flock members were herded together and killed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The other Flocks got the message.

For decades, the Neolibyans have been fighting pirates who come rushing in nimble torpedo boats, board the African transport ships, get everything valuable off board, and disappear again within 30 minutes. Other pirates are less interested in the cargo: they block the ships with wire or attach explosives to the hull. Here’s one in the eye for attacking a pirates’ nest, with kindest regards. Others throw garments infected with the pox or the plague at the crew – and then sell them the remedy. Or at least something that looks like a remedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Among those pirates are some who have changed sides: Africans who wanted to get away from the Neolibyans’ and Scourgers’ paternalism. In the Flocks, they have the same rights as everyone else, they repay every humiliation with fist and cutlass. They are said to attack their enemies like hungry hyenas when boarding a ship, tearing them apart mercilessly. Of course, the African Apocalyptics know what would happen if they ever were caught by Scourgers: they would skin the traitors or nail them to the ship’s side. That’s motivation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">After a capturing mission, the sea birds return to Europe’s Mediterranean coast. They enter estuaries, pass underwater chain barriers, and navigate to their hideouts where they unload and celebrate their success. Supposedly, some Albatrosses have dared to do the impossible: in the bellies of cannibalized boats, they built small ports and dry-docks on Bedain’s coast – right under the Neolibyans’ noses! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The steel island of Corpse is another legend. Close to the Reaper’s Blow, it remains hidden behind yellow-brown billows for weeks. Only when the wind turns does its iron wall gleam in the sunlight. For centuries, pirates have been capturing ships and sailing them to Corpse. Today, a wall of hulls lashed and partially welded together forms a barrier around the island that no Scourger squad can penetrate. If you’re looking for a ship of extraordinary quality, you should get on board. But the boat blocking the opening in the rusty wall doesn’t move for just any Albatross. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Those who want to enter need to have made a name for themselves – and be armed well enough to step into the known world’s most depraved location.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>LION'S BLOOD</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Tripol, there is a market for gambling, prostitution, and services beyond the Bank of Commerce’s tenders.

Fuel is expensive, and the roaring engines call forth from their holes all of the surrounding area’s scum.

Their thorns are hard as glass; one scratch is enough to make necrotic abscesses bloat the skin, eating away at the flesh within minutes until they reach the bone, infecting it, growing through it until it collapses and breaks under the weight of the decaying flesh. The ripe fruit and lush leaves are just as dangerous. Within, they are compartmentalized in hundreds of chambers with crystalline walls. Every chamber is filled with epigenetically active substances. When they come in contact with human cells, they cause genetic aberrations leading to a spontaneous dying of the cells, the so-called Raze. The mutation jumps from cell to cell, spreading extremely fast. The infected organism decays in minutes. There is no cure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The only exceptions are the seeds used by Europe’s Scourgers. Bitten in two, they break into a thousand splinters that enter the gums and the mucosae like glass. They don’t kill, but strengthen the Warui outside of Africa. Their effects are not generated in the stomach or the guts, but via the blood. The Anubians are almost immune to the Raze. The thorns still cause festering wounds, but the high-ranking Hogons can heal them within hours. The Anubians’ blood reacts with the Psychovore poisons, binding them and creating synergetic compounds. This leads to super cells that flood the organism. They synthesize proteins that in turn react catalytically to other Psychovore substances. The Anubian body turns into a bioreactor the complexity of which grows with every added substance: a Spitalian would barely recognize an Anubian blood sample in this phase as human. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Anubians use this to their advantage. They venture deep into the Psychovores to harvest the cherished Duat fruit, smash them, and chew the pieces. The Raze eats away at their mucosae and cheeks, but the cells are reanimated only seconds later. The poison drags them into Anubis’s realm. Their immune system collapses. Blackness runs through their veins and trickles into the flesh like running paint. In the first minutes of transition, their blood degenerates to a highly toxic concoction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">They die. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">They stand in front of the jackal-headed one, placing their soul onto the balance of his scales. In the shadows, they feel Ammit, the devourer of souls. They stare into eyes that are cold and deep as stellar mists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The bioreactor kicks in. The body vibrates from heat. The heart pounds and circulates the seething blood. A honey-like ichor wells from glands under the tongue, in the armpits, and in the groin. The body’s blackness disappears. They are grabbed, torn away from Anubis’s throne, come back into life wincing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Depending on the potency of the Duat fruit, the rigor mortis has taken minutes or days. Some Anubians become covered in the Psychovores as if in a cocoon, having to free themselves from brittle loops. Their blood is now highly potent. Drained and mixed with earth and herbs it can heal, soothe pain, or stimulate body and spirit. With time, Anubians learn the properties their blood has gained through the catalysis of various Duat fruits.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ANANSI SPIDERS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Thousands of red figures scuttle across the planes or dive into Anubis’s grass seas: the red Anansi spiders, hairless and fistsized.

They forgot their own culture. Even today, remainders of the Anubian Thread of Life can be found in the descendants of North Africans, Asians, and sometimes even the Europeans – and the Anubians look for these cast off strands. To find them, the Cult uses the Finger of Anubis, a hollow bone artfully adorned with circular and spiral engravings the length of the forearm, tapering to a fine point at the tip. These bones are rare, passed on from Anubian to Anubian, generation to generation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">According to legend, the bone is filled with jackal bile.

Only Cairo knows the answer, and Cairo is buried under Psychovores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As the Anubian lifts the canopic jar to his lips ripples form in the liquid.

Yet he still presents himself to the people as a spiritual healer, bargaining with Anubis for the life of the ill.<br /><br />When he takes the sickle and becomes an Ammit, he lets go of all rites that avail to nothing. As a warrior and guardian, he only knows action and reaction, listening to the ancestors and feeling the pull of the glaring Psychonaut Chakras. When speaking with the Scourgers, he will claim to protect the wave of creation. <br /><br />As an Embalmer, and in his next transformation as a Soul Seer, he uses the superstition. He is judge and counselor, leads villages and guides Africa’s war efforts. The Psychovores part for him and enclose his enemies. He can shut out the whispering of some of the ancestors and make room for others – not because he prays or meditates, but because he has understood the principle. Because he’s the key and the Psychovores are the lock. The people believe that ancestral spirits accompany him to pay their debts to Anubis. They believe that the spirits imbue the Psychovores. He lets them believe whatever they want to. <br /><br />The last transformation before the transition to Cairo is the Hogon. He’s far removed from his roots as a reborn Anubian. When he hands out the canopic jars, he watches the transformation. He has been present at hundreds of them and has seen the physical changes during every single one of them. Sure, those changes were few, and meaningless in and of themselves. Fingers became thinner or more delicate, hair became darker, eyebrows became thinner or moved a tiny bit. <br /><br />He’s in contact with the Spitalians and discusses these phenomena with them. How could he speak out against the white doctors for the last decades? What a lack of knowledge! Aside from the Anubians, no one is closer to the secrets than them. <br /><br />He also recognizes the circular tattoo on his belly for what it is: an indicator for the transformation. The molecules induced by the paint react to epigenetic transformation. Only when it is successful are these molecules destroyed and the Circle vanishes. <br /><br />But why? <br /><br />Why adapt? <br /><br />The next transformation brings him a little closer to the truth. <br /><br />Only two Circles to go.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE SICKLE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nAnubians feel Psychonauts at a distance of many hundreds of meters: they experience the Aberrant’s presence as a malaise. <br /><br />When a Dushani approaches the Anubian clutches his aching throat, when a Pregnoctic approaches he feels a burning pain between the eyebrows. <br /><br />The Psychonautic Chakra, the blazing star on the body’s axis, changes an Anubian’s Chakra to a dying planet.

Sideby- side with the Neolibyans, they travel the north and destroy the Aberrants where the Neolibyans’ coup de grace only tears the flesh without touching the soul.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE SOLAR CROSS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nConcentric circles, the jackal’s head, bones, and sickle play important roles in Anubian symbolism.

They receive human aspects and emotions, channel and filter them through the network and into that which Anubians and Spitalians call the Aethyr. Soul Seers know how to superimpose those waves with their own emotions and channel them back into the extraterrestrial vegetation. <br /><br />However, Anubians rarely trigger the whisper of the ancestors. Somewhere in the misty jungles, mountains, and deserts of Africa, it pulses within the Psychovores. The Anubians are always looking for its sources. <br /><br />They follow ancient drawings on brittle maps, listening to the whisper, letting themselves be guided by it. Usually the wave breaks, and the Anubians have wandered thousands of kilometers into nothing. But sometimes they find stairs leading down. Down into prehistoric vaults, into labyrinths made of glass and polished sandstone. Behind false walls, protected by pitfalls and dead ends, the first people slumber, preserved in beautiful sarcophagi eons old made of gold, lapis lazuli, and chrome. <br /><br />No Anubian with more than two Circles has ever seen one of these ancient ones. It is said that the sarcophagi are indestructible, and only an opening ritual in Cairo can unlock them. The long chain of the Thread of Life is said to be impeccable in them, inscribed into them by Anubis himself. No wrong letter, no errant passage disturbs the perfection. They are like him. In them, he will one day walk the earth. <br /><br />If one of these vaults is found, the Hogons will soon arrive. They take the sarcophagi from their bracings and carry them to a necropolis near to Cairo. They may not, cannot approach any further. The whispering of the ancients above the vault fades, only to be replaced by other waves shortly afterwards.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>BOOKS OF THE DEAD</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nThe Egyptians and the first people put books of the dead into their graves, mystical milestones into the dangerous afterlife. When the deceased’s soul finally reached the realm of the dead, it had to prove itself to Osiris and his 42 demonic assistants. If it was considered sinful, Ammit devoured the soul’s Ba. If it was considered worthy, though, it reached the celestial realm of the fields of Yaru. There, the corn was strong in the fields, and life was as it had been when the person was alive. <br /><br />The Egyptians copied this practice from the Anubians. The books contain the complete listing of the deceased person’s life essence – in a language illegible to the living. Legend has it that only Anubis himself was able to decipher the script, and he was also the one to read it to Osiris and his demons. If the passages pleased the God of the underworld, he had the books sent to Yaru along with the spirit. However, if Osiris grew bored or angry from hearing the spirits deeds, he destroyed the writings with a simple gesture. Afterwards, even Anubis could not decipher them anymore. <br /><br />Anubians retrieve books of the dead from the vaults of the first people. They are made of a deep, matte black material, and each one is massive and cannot be opened – they more closely resemble flat slabs than books. It is said that only Anubians with one or no Circles know what to make of them, but it is also said that the books will only open and talk to the Anubians once Anubis walks amongst the living again. <br /><br />The Hogons gaze upon those who own books of the dead favorably. For you don’t just find these books – they let themselves be found. Those who own one will soon go through the next transformation.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE FORBIDDEN CITY</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nCairo lies protected, deep within the stranglehold of the Psychovores.

He told them that God would come upon the world in anger, to purge it from lazy faithlessness. To pass it on to his disciples, the descendants of their progenitor Abraham so that the Seed may sprout and the land may flourish in faith.</p>\n<p>Then God crushed the world with silence and dust.</p>\n<p>The years that passed were tough, life was hard and nearly unbearable for everyone, even for those who had looked for the covenant with the last prophet. But the flames of faith burned on. Small tribes and families helped each other, rebuilding in the knowledge that they were God’s chosen children. As promised by Jehammed, a huge land spread before them that they could pacify and settle until the last prophet would return to his fold.</p>\n<p>Many followers of the Cult lost their faith in the era of the beast, gave in to the ferociousness of their urges and joined the unleashed masses of the Apocalyptics. But the Righteous Ones remained faithful. As if in a fever, they struggled through the dark days after God’s judgment day, their faces cast down in humility and in the knowledge that the eyes of the Lord were trained on them. They mastered husbandry and crafts, kept clean and took good care of themselves to keep plague and illness away from their families. They forged weapons and armor from Bygone scrap, avoided the barbarity of the simpletons and the faithless. They proudly called themselves Jehammedans. With the name came unity: they wore it like a war banner, and the faithful flocked to it. The community grew to a giant extended family that offered protection to its members – and demanded awe from its enemies.</p>\n<p>The Jehammedans spread from the Balkhan to Borca and Hybrispania and flourished where other Clans died. In the early years, they gathered all those under the roof of the faith who felt homeless and stranded in the wasteland and adhered to Jehammed’s laws.</p>\n<p>In the heart of the Balkhan, on the ruins of old Bucharest, the new center of the Jehammedan faith arose. Borcan Osman, the city of the sickle tower, converted within a few days after the Jehammedans’ ancient Iconides entered the gates and declared the covenant with God. In Hybrispania, the Cult came to reign over Castile.</p>\n<p>Its warriors, the Swords of Jehammed, were received tearfully as blessed avenging angels.

When the Anabaptists finally took up their arms, a conflict arose that couldn’t have been much crueler. The life-giving Adriatic soon was adorned with piles of corpses on the Purgan side. Just like Cain, the farmer, had killed his brother Abel, the shepherd, the Jehammedans felt victimized. The Anabaptists attacked them, raped them, killed them, smashed what the Jehammedans had built with the diligence of a thousand hands in the centuries after the Eshaton.

He stands in the progenitor Abraham’s tradition and bears the honorary title of Abrami. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As Abraham took a young slave to procreate, the Abrami takes a wife – the Hagari – to keep his house and be the mother of his children. The daughters prepare for their lives as Hagaris and help their mother, while the sons herd the flock, provide water, and guard the tents – as Jehammed decreed for an Ismaeli. Life doesn’t offer any grandeur. Only when they join the Jehammedan ranks as Swords of Jehammed, they can excel. If they prove themselves, they are allowed to found their own family as Abramis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Although the Hagari births children to the Abrami, she’s not considered his primary wife. For this the Abrami chooses a Saraeli, a virgin creature, strong and pure in her faith. Once in the cycle from spring to winter, the Abrami and the Saraeli share a bed. If a son arises from this union, the joy is boundless: the Lord has blessed the clan with an Isaaki!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This son is clad in the richest fabrics and surrounded by fatherly love. He gets the best piece of the lamb and sits next to the Abrami, but he’s also taught how to use the saber and how to ride. Day in, day out, he shapes his body and soul to be a perfect vessel of devotion to God. He is the sacrificial lamb that the family will offer to the Lord on the battlefield. There will be many opportunities for this; he rides into battle after battle. The Isaaki leads the host, galloping in front of them into the enemy ranks, a blazing example of faith and dedication. Very few live to reach their thirtieth winter, and only if God wills. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">But sometimes the Lord rejects the sacrifice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Such an Isaaki’s life’s work is not yet done: the Council of Elders makes him an Iconide, and as such, he will then lead the Cult and mark the way that God has prepared for the Jehammedans.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ICONIDES</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just as Abraham bargained with God to save the sinful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Iconides bargain for the Jehammedans’ future.

He fills two cups with sugared tea from a samovar and carries them to a low round table at the center of the room. He places one cup where he’s going to sit and the other on the opposite side, where his imaginary bargaining partner takes a seat. Chanting softly to praise God’s deeds, he is invited in.</p>\n<p>The Iconide waits patiently, sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. He meditates until he becomes aware of God. Then he brings over a small box inlaid with gold, places it at the center of the table, and opens it. Wrapped in velvet, there is a so-called Icon – a symbol for the deal.</p>\n<p>The Iconide explains to the Lord what it symbolizes: the skull of a Jehammedan torn apart by machine-gun fire stands for the wish to punish an emplacement of Scourgers with death and destruction, with the severed hand of a thief the Iconide pushes for quiet and order in a rebel village, gazing at a piece of concrete from Tripol he discusses a flood to punish the sinful city, and a broken sword is intended to lead to an Isaaki who is considered lost back to the temple of the community.</p>\n<p>The Iconide sits and recounts all the sacrifices he and his family had to make. He counts them like bills, thus buying the Icon’s symbolic value. Usually, the deal ends with old Saraelis dragging the unconscious Iconide outside to breathe fresh air and regain consciousness. He is marked by lack of sleep and food and will have to rest for days. Next comes the waiting and watching. Did he win the bargaining? What are his conditions and restrictions? It is up to the Iconide to interpret the results that reach him via messengers. Does the flood come from a devastating downpour? Does the leader of the revolt die by his concubine’s hand? Will the Swords of Jehammed be needed to exercise God’s will at the Scourger emplacement?</p>\n<p>Usually, it takes months or years before the family can be sure. If the bargain is kept, the Icon becomes a relic. If it is denied, God will have had his reasons not to fulfill the Iconide’s wish.

Stone buildings would only produce a false impression of security where alertness would be preferred. Stone is property, and a lot of property would produce haughtiness where humility would be preferred. In the scroll “The Last Days,” Jehammed implores his followers to keep moving. To sleep in tents and to avoid the stone deserts. To prefer the ram to the cornfield. To leave everything behind and make a new camp at the end of the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">For centuries, his faithful heeded his counsel.

Judges and Anabaptists claim large areas. When a group of people travels through a foreign domain in the Balkhan, hundreds of fighters rise up at the behest of the Voivodes. In spite of Jehammed’s commandment, the Jehammedans had to stake their claim and sometimes fortify or defend their land. Many have settled down.

In doing so, the Iconides revolt against the word of Jehammed: he has ordered to cut off any hand that rises against the family, be it a foreigner’s or a brother’s. The Iconides are desperate. They never had to fear an enemy within. There is no counsel on that in their scrolls.

Rumor has it that he went to Crete, where he was born. These days, the Jehammedans only hear bad news from the island. Rams’ heads and skinned, impaled Africans should be warning enough for anyone who consider approaching its shores. The inhabitants of the coast claim that the Arianoi, Aries’ messengers and Prophets of the Ram, allow no foreigners on their holy ground. <br /><br />Actually, there are several eyewitness reports from Neolibyans who floundered on Crete’s dark shores at night. They could not help but watch the terrible orgies that took place inland next to temples and bizarre labyrinths of scrap and bones. The tales of torchlight and squealing lambs staggering around in a circle of ram-headed men with open jugulars seem far-fetched. For a long time, the Scourgers laughed about the Neolibyan Wamai who claimed to have watched this gruesome spectacle. Then the Gimbya, a 500-ton transporter, ran ashore close to Tobruk on the Neolibyan coast. There were no survivors on board. The Neolibyans and Scourgers had been disemboweled and skinned. Rams’ heads were piled on the deck. The Neolibyans may rule the Mediterranean, but they have given Crete a wide berth ever since. <br /><br />The truth about Aries and his Arianoi goes much deeper than simple tales of bloody orgies. The few Arianoi who revealed themselves to their brothers in Bucharest paint a completely different picture. While Jehammed separated the Cult from the world to enable its survival, Aries is going to bring it full circle and reconcile the Jehammedans with the world. He wants them to set out, see with open eyes the miracles that they could not experience from the confinement of their clan. Leave the defensive, start attacking, use their strength to liberate Bucharest and conquer Justitian. Take the Arianois’ hands. They know the way, you children of fishermen. <br /><br />Do they still not know who Aries really is?</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":100000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"grfBXH2AJeInrsiw","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/cultcard_jehammedan.png","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>The old hatred fades.

A microphone membrane transmits the sound of every breath, every wheezing of the lungs and the squelching of the saliva-covered tubes to an amp hanging in front of the chest by a two finger-thick cables. The sounds are distorted and produce grotesque feedback as they mingle with the static noise and the mumbling of hundreds of speakers in the background. From time to time, feedbacks tear through the sea of sound, echoing through the metal corridors for seconds...</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table

difficult to trace their own origins via family trees or records back into the past through the decades. The records from pre-Eshaton times are forever lost, replaced by myths and legends of golden cities and flying humans. The past means nothing, today is everything. The Chroniclers see things differently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Before the Eshaton, they called themselves Streamers. They were more a movement of like-minded people than an organized group. The continuous flow of data linking everything, the Stream, was at the center of their interests and often their lives. The humans were the neurons in its global network, and it transmitted the impulses. Entire cultures and humanity’s knowledge had merged into the Stream and continued existing within it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Eshaton interrupted the flow of data, tore apart social structures paralleling the web of data. Centuries-old knowledge was lost. The last residues in the minds of the surviving generation were beaten out of their intelligent heads in the era of the beast. The counter had thus been reset to zero. Later on, the Chroniclers started calling the enormous catastrophe in 2073 the Zero Event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As the world around them rushed toward a new Stone Age and turned to archaic ways of civilization, the Streamers kept alive what little ancient knowledge they were able to salvage. Across all of Borca, they collected user manuals, storage devices, circuit boards, and server stacks. In the first decades, the Streamers were only technophile looters, filling basements with scrap without too much expertise. They were not yet organized, but their desire for the rebirth of the Stream seemed to propel them all down the same path. Still, they lacked a core of crystallization – a charismatic leader, a great technician or Messiah giving their deeds purpose and conjuring up a future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The year 2102 is considered the year of the founding of the Cult. In the next spring, they built a Central Cluster in a freight yard and electrified the installation’s digital heart. A Static Stream was back online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">But all Streamcasts that might shed some light on these circumstances are hidden behind cascades of passwords. No one knows the reason. Presumably, the last authorized Chronicler died centuries ago. Since then, the Chroniclers have been digging into the data, circumventing security mechanisms, overcoming barriers and installing backdoors. Using newly entered Stream data, they construct bridges across digital deathtraps and skirt defense complexes. But what hides within its core?</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>START</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵<br />@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.timeline.6j15f1Nl0YjS6WgD.JournalEntryPage.52D2v5VC674lIBPR#2109-━-cathedral-city]{2109}</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">It didn’t take long for a wild bunch of Streamers to form a community that knew only one goal: fully reactivate the Stream. Once the digital heart was beating again and old knowledge began to burst from it, the Golden Age would be near. The Streamers wanted nothing less than to revert to the time before the Eshaton. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Securing the Cologne cathedral and an adjoining museum with a computer center was the first coordinated step forward. On the surface, they found a bubble of Static Stream, extracted it, dissected it, and sank into its core. For years, they mined data, layer by layer. They made a technological leap from the status of a Stone Age cult with residual information to a high-tech organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The research was far from complete when Anabaptists stormed the cathedral in 2148. The Chroniclers were no match for these fanatics. They were overwhelmed and nailed to the ancient sacral building’s portal as heretics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Anabaptists’ reign of terror began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Large amounts of information and technology were destroyed and thus removed from humanity’s consciousness.

In a time when the Anabaptist’s blade was sharper than the digital word, their life depended on the mercy of the strong. As supplicants, they would have had to grovel before local warlords and accept a subordinate role to the rabble. They would have never reached their goals. There was only one way out.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>From that day on, power through intimidation became their new policy. No stranger has seen a Chronicler’s face since then. Shards of mirrored glass were added to their robes. A modulator amp distorts their voices. The Cultists now look and sound like irate gods. But that wasn’t enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If they had learned one thing from the Stream, it was the fact that information was power. So they made themselves indispensable. A new currency replaced simple trade, issuing so-called Chronicler Drafts in exchange for artifacts. The consigned counter value of these were pure, condensed information from the think tanks of the Cult. Crumbled sheets of paper with their barcodes and columns of numbers could be simply exchanged for directions to preserved, pre-Eshaton storages, spy data, compromising information on enemies, or scientific texts on flora and fauna at the next Cluster. Everything the Chroniclers heard was entered into the always hungry data storages and distilled for redistribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Cities could no longer avoid the Cult’s influence. Refusing a Chronicler a seat on the Council would inevitably lead to all of the Cultists leaving the city. Not to mention sudden “special” discounts on information regarding their unsuspecting leaders. Soon the Chroniclers needed no mercenaries to secure their interests. The Chroniclers had become an economical factor to the ruling class, and indispensable for a vast network of Scrappers and traders. The well-being of the Chroniclers became crucial to the prosperity of them all.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>OPERATING SYSTEM</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">REFERENCE⏵</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Chroniclers’ language is strange and eerily monosyllabic to foreigners.

Nowadays, an agreement with Spitalians allows them to occupy themselves with more important things again. The Cult takes in the children that doctors diagnose as autistic, and all youths who’ve fallen through the cracks due to their physical shortcomings. In the wasteland, strength and endurance are crucial. Children with a great deal of imagination and interests in Bygone writings are usually not good at working the land and thus cost more than they earn. As such, if the Chroniclers want to take them, all the better. They’ll feed them and give them at least a chance to survive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In groups, they are submitted to logic tests by the Chroniclers. If they pass, they are given a mentor. Those mentors become their parents of sorts, and take care of their mentees however and whenever they can. They stand alongside their young recruits when the laser marker burns a unique bar code onto their foreheads. Each recruit is then given a cell in the Cluster, where they live, sleep, learn, and work until their first promotion: their first Update. After every Update, their responsibilities change, and it is understood that they move into different security areas within the Cluster. Over the years, a young Chronicler’s profile becomes clearer, and every new responsibility better matches his knowledge and skills.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>LIFE IN THE CLUSTER</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">REFERENCE⏵</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">In the Cluster, there are only Chroniclers.

Although they mingle with humans on a daily basis to evaluate and purchase artifacts, they can hardly be considered down-to-earth.

Mostly harmless. <br /><br />While Chroniclers have been hoarding technology for centuries, everyone knows that they do not dance around it like some idol. From Bygone fragments, a technologically advanced world can arise. Unseen by ignorant eyes, the Clusters eat themselves into the ground, expanding.

All of them had garnered pass codes in the service of the Cluster that removed barriers blocking ways deep within. No secret of the Cluster was a mystery to them. They were held in high regard and unquestionably loyal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> 8 of them survived the passage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Their job was to create a network similar to the West Borcan scrap trade. As their first goal with the tower structures called Needle Towers in the East Borcan woods, they endeavored to create a radio connection between the Needle Towers and the Central Cluster. Indeed, the Fragments conquered the towers and radioed their success to the Cluster. Then their actions deviated from the plan. They surrounded themselves with an army of whores and mercenaries, and ceased answering requests from the Cluster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Back home on the other side of the Reaper’s Blow, there is not much information on the rogues. All information about them is highly classified, and may neither be sold nor shared within the Order. That said, 4 of them are known even to the lowest ranks, at least by name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Chromium and Iridium were said to have founded cities, constructing Needle Towers seen as miracles clad in glass and polished steel and communicating via mirrors. Promethium was supposed to expand the radio lines close to Osman into a relay station. According to legends, he has instead dug a tunnel into the great Osman library. Cobalt is the only other Fragment whose name is known by anyone outside of the highest ranks. A Shutter claims to have seen him near Praha, where he led a host of savages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The remaining identities of the rogues have been successfully removed from all databases, as though they encapsulated and sunk into the core as if their names alone carried power.

They activate Shutters and Fuses – elite Chroniclers whose barcodes have not been registered in the Cluster for years. Their official score is zero. They exist beyond the common system, yet are still very much present within an isolated mirror of the Static Stream. Only high-ranking Chroniclers know of their existence, and among them, few have the pass codes to issue orders to these unseen Shutters and Fuses. It’s better this way. For those few who thrive on the fringes are adept in dark deeds and use sanctioned, meaning deadly, tools, as the most technologically advanced thieves and assassins in this Cult.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE WEB EXPANDS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">REFERENCE⏵</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Central Cluster in Justitian was only the beginning. While the Chroniclers consider it ultimate and unique in its nerve-rending beauty, with its technological proliferation and the constant noise of a thousand distorted speakers, another Cluster arose in Frankan Aquitaine. It is in no way inferior to its Borcan inspiration, neither with regards to its bizarre setup nor its regional influence. In fact, Aquitaine has been steadily rising within the internal ranking over the last few years. East of the rural areas, the steel cadavers of planes and ship hulls were joined into a labyrinthine jungle of ancient technology by chain bridges and catwalks. Ships shot to pieces and broken parts of oil rigs hang in the silt like insects in a web, and every day, new flotsam crashes against their steel hulls. More and more Chroniclers go here seeking the special artifacts that wash ashore. Scrappers climb from ship to ship, cutting them apart with arc welders or exploring their cargo holds. With nets, they recover crates from the water. The granulate they toss back into the sea, but the machinery – wrapped in oilcloth and perfectly preserved – they drag to the Chroniclers. They have found quite a lot already! Black steel tubes clinging to one another like lugworms, dull white cubes that even a knife cannot scratch, spindles of light metal wrapped in bands of glowing stones full of cables and boards. The Chroniclers dig into these artifacts like predators, ecstatically dissecting everything they can get their hands on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Yet they have no idea what it all is. Why have these ships been torn apart? Were humans on board at one point? Perhaps there is some connection to the strange symbols on these ships? No one in Europe has ever seen their linear and circular drawings. Are they letters? No one can even understand or place them. The Scrappers are asked the same question every time they return from their raids with new artifacts. “Corpses?” They shake their heads, snorting or spitting. Forced to give the same response every time, much to their chagrin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Chroniclers have learned to take that as a “no”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Clusters in Justitian and Aquitaine are the largest ones, but not the only ones. Smaller Clusters can be found in almost any larger Borcan and Frankan city. The Needle Tower Disaster stopped them from spreading across the Reaper’s Blow into East Borca and beyond early on. Though the Spitalians had paid their respects to the Cult’s Fragments and invited them to establish a base in Danzig, Pollen, they had only turned up their Vocoders and answered “Zero!” In the far west, it is the same story. The Cultists’ insubordination grows in sync with their distance to the Central Cluster, the Fragments suspect. Plus, their safety is uncertain. While Chroniclers are indispensable in Borca where their sheer presence garners respect and T H E MIRROR The Clusters hoard enormous amounts of knowledge. The Static Stream expands in fractal coils, attached data is assimilated and fills gaps. It approaches a critical mass.

Although the Cult’s ways of life differ widely, they share a common history. Ever since the Chroniclers initiated the building of Justitian with the founding of the Central Cluster in that small freight yard, the Judges have been at their side. There has never been an official treaty, but both know what they have in each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> The relationship with the Hellvetics is different.The Chroniclers have always coveted the Alpine Fortress. In its stone labyrinths, ancient computer systems work, managing the Hellvetics’ merits and Central storage. Endless knowledge and surely a piece of Static Stream must be trapped in there. The Chroniclers would love to extract it, but the descendants of the Swiss military have always denied the Cult any kind of access. No reasons given. They do not listen to reason. “Why do you do that?” scream the overloading Vocoders. But the Hellvetics are experts at keeping neutral and are unimpressed by the Chroniclers’ demands, regardless how much they whine or struggle to order them around. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The old enmity with the Anabaptists has ceased since the Fragment Modus came to Cathedral City, now enjoying the hospitality of Orphid the Baptist.

The Anabaptists as well as the Chroniclers have been ordered to keep the peace between the Cults as long as this hospitality remains undisturbed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">In the meantime, many Anabaptists see Chroniclers as a necessary evil. Someone must dig up the technological corruption that can undoubtedly be attributed to the Demiurge, and that is exactly what the Chroniclers do. Like the bacteria of decay that decompose corpses. “That is about how good they smell, too”, the Anabaptists joke. No one sees the Chroniclers faces behind their masks. They are grinning.

At the same time, flickering walls of images awaken all over Borca. Single panels are missing and clusters of pixels are dead, but the shapes of Chroniclers passing in an endless march are recognizable. The images are jerky and distorted by static noise.

Those waiting for recovery in the infirmaries were told via speakers to leave the region: “The Spital is closed, effective immediately. Go home.” From helplessness, a wave of anger arose, leading once again to violence. But HIVE was already rampant amongst the attackers, thinning out their ranks. Siege machinery and weapons fell from limp infected hands. The resistance was broken long before the battle was joined. Meanwhile, the doctors watched the events outside their walls from barred windows and high rooftops. Their eyes mirrored the despair of the diseased. Sympathy and sense of duty warred against self-preservation in their minds. Some doctors couldn’t stand it and jumped from the Spital’s roof.

The doctors lost ground, the strings on which the world danced to their tune were torn. Since 2221, strange mutations had occurred in Pollen, and now they ran rampant in Borca, too. Swarms of insects flooded the land, entering body cavities and stinging, biting, laying eggs. Spore fields blossomed everywhere, conquered one region after the other.

They studied the Psychonauts and their Raptures, with new technologies like the Noumenon Vocalizer they sought out the Chakra collectives’ ether flickers and established the Primer theory.

The specially trained Hygienists watch this procedure, check the excrements, and report to their supervisors if anything should come up. The procedure is exhausting, but the Spitalians consider it redemption, a “de-fearing,” as it unties the knot of anxiety in their chest and certifies that they have the necessary purity.

The solution is enriched with epigenetic surrogates facilitating a spore infection and binding toxins to prevent decay. This brew needs several days to ripen, and then the doctors relocate the now infected muscles into glasses with fresh nutrient solution.

When Psychonauts or spore-afflicted people get close to such a container, the muscle cramps spasmodically. Time and again it beats against the glass hard: the dull knocking growing to a frenzied staccato as the Mollusk gets closer to the active spore source. The trembling tissue beats the liquid to a foaming froth until the final contact.</p>\n<p>However, the Mollusk only reacts to living beings that have opened the channel to an Earth Chakra through their spore infestation: spore laden Psychonauts, Burners on the drug, and carriers of the Seed.

Whether you’re the scion of a meritorious Surgeon or had to watch your family being taken away by body carts from a dirty bed in the Appendix while an Orderly took care of you: all Spitalians start their career in the Appendix’s lingering illnesses as equals, with no shortcuts or perks granted due to their pedigree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As a Recruit, the young Spitalian collects experience and learns to accept the ichor-suffused reality. The first step is easily taken, and he can soon call himself an Orderly. He is burdened with more responsibility that accompanies him until he starts studying medicine as a Famulancer. New perspectives arise: which departments is he interested in, what are his skills? While Famulancers walk the Spital’s chalked halls and discuss germ theory in an academic atmosphere with like-minded people, their honeymoon period is only brief. A Consultant forms a platoon to defend Danzig, and marching orders can reach anyone who hasn’t made himself indispensable elsewhere. The Famulancer goes to the Surgeons’ dissecting rooms, offers to clean the fermenters, helps at the Hygienist gates, cleans surgical instruments. Simple tasks one and all, but he shows interest and initiative – and makes himself useful. The clock stops, he does not have to fear conscription anymore, and a new life in the halls of the Surgeons, Epigeneticists, Pharmacists, Hygienists, Anaesthesiologists, Hippocrats, or general practitioners begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">So far, the Famulancer is only an afterthought in the department. Years later, he will prove his worth to the department’s representative: a passed exam strengthens his position and allows him to bear his department’s title. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">From now on, the rungs of the career ladder are few, fragile and far apart. At the top of the department is its Representative, who deals out jobs and responsibilities. Only the Consultants stand above them – they shape the doctors’ ideology and specify their goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Registrar is the Consultants’ voice: he passes on orders to the departments and will become the next Consultant – if he survives that long. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">After 60 years of hard work in the service of the Spital, Spitalians are awarded the title of Elder: a genuflection before old age. They can pass on responsibilities to proxies, they meet and debate. Only they are allowed to openly criticize the Consultants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Finally, the Preservists. This branch exists outside the hierarchy. Those who discern themselves from the masses through an extreme mindset or extreme deeds (or rather: disqualifies himself from belonging to the masses) might be called to Arnsberg by Provost Kranzler himself. There, several years of training begin during which the aspirant’s mind is shattered and rebuilt as a mosaic according to Kranzler’s wishes. The Preservists’ job? To defend the Spital and humanity – and to do things that would be just too much for a common Surgeon.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>THE SPITAL</h2>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE OUTER RING: APPENDIX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Summer drives the cold from the tundra. The soil thaws, blue and red blossoms explode in to cool teal. People step from their huts, stretching towards the sun and getting rid of their furs. The land awakens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">For the pathogens, a new year has begun. The warmth tickles bacteria from their hibernation, cesspits spew dysentery, cholera, and typhus into the villages. Lice and ticks burst from their eggs to ambush humans – carrying spirochetes, hepatic viruses and yersinia pestis. Death’s arsenal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Spitalians have long since ridden out to disinfect septic tanks and open bodies of water, and to vaccinate the citizens of Justitian. Still, they cannot completely suppress the epidemics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Every year, a stream of diseases pushes through the Black Lungs’ city canyons towards the Spital. The access roads have been freed from wreckage and old cars by healed people as a means to give thanks. Stone altars along the way speak of the healed people’s thankfulness. Colorful ribbons flutter on poles, wreaths made of weeds and animal sacrifices lie half-buried in the dust. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one can say for sure where exactly the change from the ruin field into the outer sick bays begins, nor when this transition is complete. Suddenly, a newcomer stands amidst wheezing, rag-clad figures, passes tents, and smells vomit and antiseptics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Spitalians coldly call this area “the Appendix,” an unloved appendage. Their Recruits and Orderlies register every arrival, make a first diagnosis, name the price for the treatment, and put the diseased one in a bed according to their illness. The area is strictly divided into sick bays for the various diseases: the cholera quarter, the plague alley, the dysentery avenue, stretching into a ring around the Spital at the center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">In busy times, the Appendix is a city full of flickering life. In times of helplessness, it’s a necropolis stinking of decay. Some of the dark, towering buildings are labeled with warning signs crudely painted with red paint and broad brushes that cover the building’s entire facade. Other buildings are only charred concrete skeletons, cleansed of germs by fire bursts from Spitalian burners. Tents and huts made from metal scraps sprout in the many overcrowded quarters. No one dares leaving their assigned area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As bizarre as it may seem, among all the ragged, mucusspitting and slowly dying people, there is a normal kind of life in this city of the damned. Families stay with their diseased members, fulfilling menial tasks, beggars press themselves against the walls of houses and ask for food and water, merchants covering their mouths and noses with wet rags offer processed fruit, tubers, and lichen at inflated prices. The Spitalians’ options in this area of longtime sickness are limited, and many who have traveled from afar die horribly while waiting for overburdened doctors who fight through streams of whimpering people day by day. There are nights when the wind comes from the southeast and one swears that the crying and moaning of the dying ones can be heard as far as Tech-Central in the center of Justitian, wailing like the distant screams of the damned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one in the Appendix can be sure not to end up like the dying man in the hut next door.

Spitalians stand guard on the battlements, staring grimly down into the Appendix with their Fungicide Rifles at the ready. The message is clear. No diseased person may pass the disinfection basins without authorization! <br /><br />Beyond the wall, there is the Corpus. This inner ring was once supposed to add warehouses, parking garages, labs and operating theatres to the Spital. The complex was never finished. Now, bunker foundations jut from the ground like dental necks. Pillars form concrete forests, steel trusses hint at roofs. The roads are channels cutting through this bunker world, their branches leading into the research groups’ labs and storage rooms via ramps. The main road from the gates to the central Spital is the Corpus’ lifeline. Everyone here knows his way around and walks it as unswervingly as an ant follows its queen’s pheromone trail. No stranger will ever have to keep his bearings in the Corpus. The few diseased who have bought better treatment are brought into the public hospitals by the gates at once where they stay until they’re cured, and they’d better not violate their house arrest as the security here is extremely tight. The Corpus is a dangerous place. In the high-security labs, the effects of diseases on animals are researched, and next to them, ramps lead down in the subterranean storage facilities for spore and plague victims. Almost no other place in the wasteland has the same potential to end all of mankind.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>SPITAL</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Spital itself resembles a fortress. An elongated concrete block with its cylindrical water and fungicide towers and other structures is expanded in several places by extensions belonging to various departments. The overhanging floors of the main bar throw shadows on the lower floors and darken the surrounding trench. A Spitalian who descends and stomps through the red dust encounters a hated part of Spital history. A lantern’s light falls upon iron plates and walled-off windows, scars mar walls that are fire-blackened over many meters. Someone once tried in vain to break through here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one has to go down there. Bridges span this chasm, which is more than five steps wide at the main entrances. Those who want to enter this hoard of infinite knowledge must have their urine tested for spore infestation by the Hygienists. A complete purification in the disinfection bath completes the check-up, cleanses the body and caresses the soul – we are pure inside and the dangers stay outside. The Spitalian takes a bag of shrink-wrapped clothing, tears it open, and puts on the white linen top and pants. His equipment will be cleaned and stored for him. Every Spitalian works towards the day when he may finally walk the chalk-white, brightly lit corridors. He will find a place amidst the libraries, reading rooms, labs and factories, amidst generators and fermenters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">If he joins a department, he moves to its wing. The Surgeons have several operating theatres, an auditorium, and the Panopticon, where they exhibit medical curios for their colleagues. Hopefully not just to shock new arrivals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Intensive care right next to the operating theatres is the domain of the Anaesthesiologists. Next to it is the general medical wing. Patients don’t have to go far from bed to surgery. Needing space, the Pharmacists use up a complete building block. It is home to the Community Pharmacy, where drugs are handed out, and several reading rooms and labs where fermenters and stills bubble and rustle day and night. Epigenetics stands as the most modern department, its wing fully electrified. The Hippocrats have taken over the second floor, monitoring compliance with statutes and ethical rules. From here, they can descend into every department without going through the lobby. They like it that way. The rest of the doctors don’t. The second floor is also home to the secret archives with dossiers on rogue doctors and the printing facilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Everything is in the Hippocrats’ hands. The Hygienists feel at home everywhere, but of course they also have their own wing with de-sporeing chambers as well as bodysuit maintenance. The sign above the entrance says “South Wing II”. Those who enter here will get to feel what the Hygienists think of cleanliness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Additional landmarks in the Spital are the registry, the public library, the garages, the prosthetics workshop, and the arsenal behind “Gate 6”. Here, the Spitalians can get weapons and expedition equipment, provided they have a warrant. Phosphor grenades and gas cartridges are built in the Pharmaceutics wing: for security reasons, chemical and biological weapons are not stored for more than 24 hours in the arsenal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Those who come across doors with the warning word “HIVE” sprayed upon them should simply keep walking. HIVE victims broke into the cellars centuries ago and died there. No one ever retrieved the bodies.

The latter excrete a milkwhite liquid that is said to have properties similar to Vitamin C: it precludes decay and can be used to treat deficiency symptoms.

Today, the doctors rarely find cockroaches or moths in the corridors. <br /><br />However, the task actually assigned to the arachnids is a completely different one: they spin cocoons around plague-ridden corpses and thus conserve them for later examinations. In the caverns, hundreds of cocoons are stuck to the walls.

The first reports were found in the African outback and were penned by the Libyan. He was a merchant, a shrewd accountant and very enterprising. He catered for the survivors and thus wove the network of contacts that would support him until the end. His trading posts along the African Mediterranean coast were like seeds that soon sprouted into strong cities. One of them was Tripol: according to history the Libyan’s home village started amidst the ruins of ancient Tripoli. Here the streams of commerce met – at least that’s what the books say – and brought unexpected wealth not only to the Libyan: tea, expensive fabrics, oil in amphorae, sacks full of grain, and metalwork piled up in the warehouses and caverns. The ancestral spirits looked favorably upon the city. Tripol blossomed.</p>\n<p>The Libyan’s enterprises had grown too big to be controlled by him alone. The lists dating back to those days count hundreds of packers, helping hands, and scribes, some of them former competitors whom the Libyan had vanquished in wars of trade. Other cost items indicate that some of the profit was funneled back to the populace. The Libyan paid for the construction of meeting halls and had workers create fields or fortified canals.

His face became soft and relaxed then, and his voice sounded deeper. He asked them all to sit, and brewed and served tea. He waited until they all had sipped some.

Now, dark, looming figures are looking down upon us from many walls. Their bodies consist of complex patterns, their faces hidden behind shields like death masks of red ash. While their bodies vary in color and design from wall to wall, the masks are all alike. Eight keep reappearing. They represent the eight ancestors. They are spirits guarding their descendants. They will guide them in the terrible days when the white people will come.</p>\n<p>The cities are still burning, but in the hinterland, armies of black and red lines are forming. At first, they are singular, small groups, some led by animals or hybrids of lion, gazelle, and hyena, others surrounded by some sort of light. One by one they unite, becoming a rolling sea, surrounded by the eight giant ancestors looking down on their people – some gracious or angry, others mad with rage or sadness. But they all lead the way to the ground molested by chalk lines, point with their fingers to the perpetrators.</p>\n<p>The dark clouds are now almost above the city, hiding the sun. The first drops hit the street, stamping craters into the dust and making the steppe grass tremble. Soon, the tempest will wash away any dirt, and the roaring of the water will be the only sound in the jungle for many hours to come.</p>\n<p>Before us is another building. The painted plaster has fallen from the mud bricks in large areas. But the image of the dark figure with the great muscles and the angry look can still be easily seen due to its size. The figure is wrestling with the white man, grabbing the hand holding a cat o’ nine tails. The drawing next to it shows the dark figure – the African – gloating over the prone white man and grabbing his whip. There is one image after the other.</p>\n<p>The Scourge now cuts glowing lines into its former owner’s body. The black lines chase the white ones from their cities and keep pushing them into the land of chalk lines. The hybrid creatures and animals stay home, while the eight ancestors accompany the fighters to battle.</p>\n<p>Again, cities burn. But they are crude, barbaric and inhabited by the pale chalk lines.</p>\n<p>We are in the present time.</p>\n<p>Rain keeps hammering the ruins, torrents run over the house fronts and collect in seething puddles.

On certain days, sacrifice or irreverence causes the barrier to dwindle, and powers and souls float to the other side. This exchange guarantees the balance.

Never. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">With one exception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Africa stood on the brink of ruin. The Lion lay torn; thousands of beak wounds spilled his blood, and the Crows were marching on his dying body. At that time, the eight ancestors caressed his sides and lent him strength. They breathed life into him again and gave him anger. The Lion rose, rid himself of the bird plague, and shouted out his anger, making himself heard even in the northern lands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The power of the eight ancestors flowed through young warriors throughout Africa – they had been chosen to repel the Europeans as champions of the eight. Years later, these warriors were only known by the name Scourgers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The results of this choice of the eight can be felt today, for the African people still see the Scourgers as closely related to the ancestors. They expect a lot of them: not only to defend the land, but also to safeguard its traditions against the ravages of time. Whenever an African is caught lying, has done some damage to another African, or even needs to move a rock to build his hut, the Scourgers are called in. The Scourgers decide in the spirit of the traditions, and they decide quickly. Liars may not speak until the good spirits of the village send a sign, those who have caused damage to others have to repair that damage, even if they must do so by their own hands’ work, the rock may only be moved if no one in the village opposes the idea and the spirit inhabiting the rock has been pacified with sacrifices for a whole month.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>WARUI</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Swahili, Arabic, Hausa, Malinke, Kikongo, Amharic, Somali, and thousands of other languages were spoken in Africa, some by populations of hundreds of millions, others by a few dozen people on the brink of extinction. Even decades after the Eshaton, the variety of languages in Africa was overwhelming, but it has declined more and more during the past centuries.</p>\n<p>It started in the south, close to the Psychovores. The people lost their fathers’ tongue and communicated on a rudimentary level with simple words, clicks, and other basic sounds. This new language formed images in the minds of its users, conveying a painful intensity of emotions with few phonemes. The Scourgers call it Warui, meaning “from the river”. They consider it the legacy of the eight ancestors who pierced the barrier by interfering with the human world and making way for a flood of emotions and ancient knowledge. Those who drink from this river are rid of the intellectual ballast of centuries, of grammar and vocabulary, and regain the first and most primordial of all languages in which the spirits and ancestors communicate with the Africans.</p>\n<p>Without the Warui, the Scourgers hailing from villages and cities all over Africa could never have joined together. In battle, it unites the warriors’ souls in a way that is far beyond human language.</p>\n<p>But in the cold north, the ancestors’ influence diminishes, and so does the strength of the Warui. The link between the Scourgers is breaking. Like invalids, they stumble through a world they had stormed before relying on grammatical constructs and worn-out phrases.

To deny him would mean offending the ancestors. However, there are limits to what a Scourger can demand. If he’s thought to be immoderate – hoarding riches or demanding gifts that he doesn’t need to do his job, for example – his brothers and sisters take care of him. Quickly, and without much ado. Wherever he may indulge these debaucheries, be it at a Neolibyan’s table or in a brothel’s bed, they grab him and drag him away, kicking and screaming. Outside, they tie him to a pole naked and torture him until he loses consciousness, laughing all the while.

There’s a tingle that runs through the body, the breath quickens, and gibberish floods the mind. They have accomplished something. They feel to the core of their being.</p>\n<p>Every ancestor plucks the string of life in his own special way, and every ancestor appears alone. The emotions he triggers jump from person to person and spread like a bubble. The people are carried by the wave: at the epicenter, the emotions smash the walls of reason and determine the people’s thoughts, emotions, and actions.</p>\n<p>A few hundred paces further out, the effects fade. The emotions sink to the subconscious. They guide without resulting in full turns. Days later, the influence fades completely or is replaced by other emotions, another ancestor.</p>\n<p>Scourgers and Anubians are especially sensitive to this. While Anubians lower their gaze in silent meditation, the Scourgers become inspired and exercise every aspect of the ancestor. They don’t know his name: the eight ancestors come from a time and sphere that has no room for words, only emotions and conflation as experienced today in the Warui or in dreams, nowhere else. To discuss these ancestors, one has to choose the roundabout way, talking about their aspects or using metaphors.</p>\n<p>The first ancestor is often characterized as an eagle. He soars above everything, broadening his gaze to the horizon of his own being, but also taking in his surroundings. He strengthens intuition and gives hints of the future.</p>\n<p>The second ancestor embodies the strength and superiority of the Lion. If this ancestor comes over a region, the people square their shoulders, compete with one another in duels, and take on any challenge.</p>\n<p>The third ancestor is like earth in one’s hand, like a wall crumbling to dust because of a thought, like an earthquake. He manifests in the form of creative energy and of physical and mental exhaustion. Under his influence, great works of art and giant buildings are created.</p>\n<p>The fourth ancestor opens people’s hearts. He is community and love. Joining on a spiritual level, he tears down barriers.</p>\n<p>The fifth ancestor is pure physical desire, colliding bodies that have only one goal: sexual reproduction. The sixth ancestor blows like a clear thought through the minds of the affected. The thousand layers of communication with their meta-meanings and lies crumble until only one layer remains. Every word is understood as intended. Every thought is a blazing star rising in the thinker’s mind.</p>\n<p>The seventh ancestor only appears where at least two ancestors’ influences collide. He superimposes them and unites their aspects. The Scourgers see him as the source of Warui.</p>\n<p>The eighth ancestor is the shadow cast by the other sevens’ light. He overwhelms and oppresses. His teeth and thorns catch every thought. People under his influence who may have been open-minded and friendly a moment ago suddenly act subversively and only for their own gain. But the Africans accept it without complaint. Their world has always been full of good and evil spirits: both are a part of the order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>UNTO DEATH</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nBeing a Scourger is not a birthright, but great deeds do not help a young African to become part of the warrior caste, either. It’s a mother’s sole decision: no amount of complaining will help if she thinks that a Neolibyan would be good for the family. Many a boy flees into the jungle looking for a Scourger pack willing to take him in. But no, if the child is not handed over by the mother herself, the warriors chase them away. <br /><br />Once a Scourger, he has to prove himself worthy at the age of 12. In the vicinity of Gibraltar, he will have to hunt down a freed slave. In Tripol, he will be abandoned in the jungle to confront wild animals, equipped only with a spear. The rites of acceptance vary from place to place, but they are all life-threatening. The applicant should not expect anyone to help. Even if a slave bashes his head in, the Scourgers will not interfere. Either the ancestors elect the child and lend their strength to the applicant, or not. If not, maybe they would’ve been better off as a Scrapper or Neolibyan after all. <br /><br />After this trial, the child is presented as a Scourger in his home village. Now he can draw on the Neolibyans. <br /><br />Between the age of 12 and 28, all Scourgers are cared for by their village’s community. These adolescents and adults may not marry: their deaths would cause existential problems for their partners. Of course, this does not stop them from having purely sexual relationships. <br /><br />After the age of 28 and a rite of passage, they swear to use their heads more and their fists less. They are now considered elders. They still fight, but now they act from the background and are now more responsible for planning missions. Older Scourgers may marry, but are fully liable for their partners and children. The Neolibyans are only obligated to take care of the warrior himself, not any of their hangers-on. The Scourger may still not work, though. Usually the profit from the selling of slaves to Neolibyan plantations guarantees suitable life with two to three partners for them. But they never get away from the fighting. <br /><br />At the age of about 50 – a foggy line, because many Scourgers stop counting the years once they become elders – they are considered sages. They lead their villages, passing judgment or entering a permanent liaison with their ancestors as shamans or hermits. Their numbers are few. The calmer years as an elder do not make up for the stressful life as a warrior. <br /><br />Not many reach the age of 45.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"CIWQZLE8LyfjkiH6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/cultcard_scourgers.png","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;height:120px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:71px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px;height:71px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>A white man’s warrior clan, guardians of Purgare and Southern Borca.

Hundreds of thousands streamed into the Recombination Group’s subterranean facilities all over the world under cover of night. They gazed straight ahead, there was no doubt in their eyes. They were beautiful people: strong and powerfully built, their skin without blemish. Everyone knew them as the “Guardians”. With long strides, they went down into the mountain, through whitewashed, brightly lit corridors. They followed the signs, endless colorful lines. They went past operation theaters and ignored the generator rooms, the provisionary systems, and a forest of Freon tanks.</p>\n<p>They marched on.</p>\n<p>A hall opened up before them: thousands of tubes, all larger than a man, some standing, others lying on the floor or piled upon each other. Red and green lights flickered in turn, cables and hoses from the cylinders disappearing into the ceiling.</p>\n<p>The Guardians spread out and attacked the cylinders. They touched control panels, removed digital barriers. Inside, something hissed, and then the tops opened. Icecold mist from the inside drifted across the floor. Men, women, and children lay silently in the cylinders. They slept. Hoarfrost glittered on their skin. The lids were tight over the frozen eyes, and their cheeks sunken in. They were all ill, most of them frozen in the throes of death, awaiting a treatment that never came.</p>\n<p>The Guardians could have woken them. But what should they have answered to the questions and the screaming, the nervous “Am I healed?” or “What are you doing to me?” It would have added unacceptability to unpostponability.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Guardians put on gloves and took the bodies from the chambers. Bones and flesh cracked like ice. With scrapers, they removed the remainders, cleaning the cold chambers. They threw complete bodies as well as single arms and legs into carts, piling them up in a wild mix of limbs. Electro cars came, and cart after cart was hooked to them until they finally started moving with a hum.</p>\n<p>They drove to the storage halls. Endless halls with pillars, empty, the end barely visible to the naked eye. The electro cars unhinged the carts and returned. They carried everything here that the sleeping chambers had to offer.</p>\n<p>The work was done. One Guardian stood at the entrance and let his gaze drift across the army of carts. There had to be more than a hundred, all filled with what looked like a butcher’s leftovers. He switched off the light, closed the doors, locked and sealed the halls for eternity. No one noticed that some of those trapped inside awoke – this transgression remained unpunished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>SEALED</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Guardians formed an honor guard when their wards arrived in armored cars and climbed down into the Dispensers.

They had numbers on their wrists, all multiples of 100: there were 100s and 200s and 300s – up to the 900s. People in white coats were already waiting at the glass cylinders and hailed the newcomers. With a machine the size of their hand they scanned the tattoos, nodding. Everyone was tense, that feeling of being part of something big was ubiquitous. They were in a festive mood, like at one of Getrell’s announcements. But today, the gift was not self-awareness but survival.</p>\n<p>Ten days later, the newcomers had become Sleepers. Locked in the chambers, their eyes gazed out of crystalline nanite meshes. Shining green displays confirmed the cryostasis. Then the lights went out, the doors closed. Heavy steel bulkheads snapped into their bracings. The countdown had begun. 100 years until the first ejection.</p>\n<p>The Guardians lived on the outer ring. They maintained the backup systems and bioreactors, watched the data stream from the facility’s core: the Sleeper Chambers. This data stream really was something. Those who tried to find a pattern in the flood of gene and human parameters soon were successful. Too soon, some of the Guardians thought, but their warnings remained unheard. All the Sleepers carried within them a special combination of genes that made them… divine? According to data, there was no other possible conclusion.</p>\n<p>It was all a facade.

Seeing became less important, other senses like hearing and touch took over leadership from the eyes. When the darkness threatened to swallow them completely, the Guardians scratched their collective knowledge into the walls. With fingers caressing the scratches, one could experience the last days of light, learn about the Sleepers’ powers, or listen to problems and fears of Guardians who had lived many years ago. A history in stone. Next, the intercoms died. The Guardians replaced them with a tube system that wound through the bunker in endless curves.

The bioreactors leaked and spilled organic matter throughout the corridors, cable insulations became brittle and cracked, displays flashed for one last time and then blacked out. The technology in the bunker facilities was slowly wearing itself down, and there was nothing that the Guardians could do about it.

A Paler with a deep, resonant voice is more influential than one who speaks in a falsetto. Children with a strong vocal power were made to train their pronunciation.

His memetics develop along with his nature: Rato, a Demagogue of fear, controls his subordinates through terror and punishes deviance with panic, the words of Chire, a Demagogue of violence, hurt like whip lashes, and Jiklas’ people indulge in the intoxication of song to forget the terrors of the outside world. Within the Cult, these influences work very well as they were created specifically as tools to control the Cult. But the abovegrounders also feel the fire in the vocal power of the Demagogues. It doesn’t burn their very soul like it does to the Palers, but it bends and twists something deep inside them: implanting fear even if the voice itself sounds very soft and sweet, luring them into a trap, hurting like hell, making gums bleed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AWAKENED</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>There had to be others like them out there, that threw themselves against the portals with broken hydraulic coils.

But those who accept it find salvation through insight. This insight can take many forms. To understand and transcend it takes a whole lifetime. According to the Neognosis, God and the world are opposites on a large scale, while mind and matter are opposed on a small scale. Once, both principles were separate: God’s breath, the Pneuma, was clear and good, matter was dark and bad. It was the Demiurge who mixed two opposites and thus sealed his fate and the fate of the world. Humans are pure divine breath caught in a prison of flesh. The Neognosis describes the body as corrupt and dirty, and this is how Anabaptists see and treat it, too. Only death breaks open this prison, allows the Pneuma to flow out and rejoin the source: absolute knowledge. But between death and the reunion with God, there is a long drift through nothing riddled with chunks of decaying matter. An unenlightened soul wanders aimlessly, gets stuck easily and devolves into a new physical incarnation.

Didn’t people become unbalanced and hectic when they were exposed to the miasma of cities like the terrible Exalt? When they were ill, didn’t they reek of decay and pus?

Around it, even the heretic Bygones would have noticed God’s greatness and felt inspired to do great things.</p>\n<p>When they were riding through the wild wheat of the river Rain one day with the ears of wheat caressing their legs, their breath caught. In the haze, they saw a giant tower, a cathedral. So often had they passed this spot, lost in thought or in conversation with each other. They had harvested the Rain wheat and sowed it in faraway regions. But that day, the cathedral seemed to them like a hint of God.</p>\n<p>The insight hit them as cold as mountain water, and they stood and stared. The Demiurge must have stricken them with blindness and ignorance for centuries. They sank to the ground and buried their hands into the soil, rubbing the wheat straw and inhaling its scent.

The cathedral at its banks would become the center of their faith as it had attracted pious people ages ago.</p>\n<p>But the building was afflicted with heretics and other vile people. A technology Cult calling themselves the Chroniclers had dug deep into the catacombs. Whatever they were doing down there, it surely helped the Demiurge rather than the Lord. Thousands of Neognostics armed with war spades and picks marched against an enemy that a dozen could have vanquished.</p>\n<p>That day, the Chroniclers suffered a defeat that they would never recover from, but for Rebus’ host the liberation was just one of many successful skirmishes.</p>\n<p>The host had been fragmented into several congregations, but now their religious lives became more centered. Rebus’ host dug wells and caverns to collect water and built aqueducts to channel it to the fields. They cultivated the wild wheat and sowed the city’s surroundings with it. The aqueduct artery grew.

Those amongst them who go to sleep with the Neognosis and awake again with a quick prayer on the lips detest the body as a carnal burden caught in sin. They work the land to help Paradise shake off its rigor mortis – only when the soil is strong will it be able to feed Rebus’ fighters in the final battle. Only late at night, when the muscles ache and the body gets weak, do they retreat to their chambers and give thanks for the work they are allowed to do. They dissociate themselves from their bodies through pain and meditation to finally break their chains and become one with the Pneuma. They suppress physical needs as if they were a blemish sent by the Demiurge. They starve themselves and deny copulation and other forms of sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, sure,” the Orgiastics say and start laughing. For them, this entire Ascetic talk is a big joke and definitely nothing to imitate.</p>\n<p>They are what has become of Rebus’ warrior caste: they protect the Ascetics on the fields and attack Psychonauts and anyone who raises a hand against Rebus’ host in violent gangs. While those amongst them who follow the faith see themselves as marked by the Demiurge like the Ascetics do, they believe in the superiority of their spiritual souls. They are above carnal desires and get rid of their human urges via excessive violence and orgies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>SYMBOLISM</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The symbol of the cross, coupled with the broken wheel, points to Christian Gnostic roots.

Not even Eve could resist the apple.</span></p>\n<br />The teachings concerning the Demiurge are considered bullshit by many of these Touched Ones for many years. The Baptists in Cathedral City don’t care. Those who join the Cult at least don’t work for the enemy. Additionally, the community has a place for everyone, be it as an Ascetic working the land or as an Orgiastic on the battlefield. There comes a time when everyone has to prove his worth. <br /><br />In the first year, Cathedral City pairs the Touched Ones with a senior Anabaptist who serves as a confessor and guide. He teaches his Touched One the basics of the Neognosis and how to recognize friends and enemies of the Cult. The Touched is the Anabaptist’s lackey, helping him get dressed and performing menial tasks.<br /><br />In his spare time, the new arrival explores Cathedral City or the Anabaptist camp in which his mentor is stationed. For days or weeks, he joins Orgiastic gangs or toils with the Ascetics in the fields. He has not pledged his life to the Cult yet and can leave his current service at any time to explore another aspect of the community the next day. But he should not expect the Anabaptists’ patience to be boundless. He has at most one season to come to terms with himself: Where does he stand? How does he intend to gain insight? Does he want to liberate his mind through excesses and risk his life in battle against the Demiurge’s monsters, or does he want to gain entrance to heaven through hard work? <br /><br />One last time, he chooses a gang, though he remains with this one until the end of his days. His new brothers and sisters embrace and kiss him and lead him to his quarters. They anoint him just as Rebus anointed his chosen – and then grab the tattooing needle.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>INITIATION</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whether Ascetic or Orgiastic, every Anabaptist wears a nose ring.

Without a modicum of Neognostic devotion, an Ascetic remains on the fields and an Orgiastic on the front.</p>\n<p>Those who want more start searching for the Seed. It’s a little thing, but if you water it, it grows to be something bigger that produces new seeds. This is how Rebus described his first divine insight, which led to many more. Seeds require hard work, however, just like a garden doesn’t thrive without the investment of energy. Only those who question themselves on a daily basis and try to see the big things in the small things will feel the Seed within them and be able to make it sprout – to partake in divine emanations.</p>\n<p>The emanations are individual, and every devoted Anabaptist would be well advised to explore them in his mind. For some they are glaring visions, others believe to hear voices, and then there are those who feel an undefined mental change within their soul, as if they were keyed to a divine pole like a compass needle. Most reach this state during their days of hard work or seemingly lost battles, when heart and lungs pump and the enemies’ hot blood is still running from their fists. Some take a shortcut and invent visions. They should be as cryptic as possible: giant stones, a blood-soaked sky, hands reaching down from the clouds, burying themselves in Paradise’s heaving body. There are frauds, but their descriptions often lack the excited passion and transcendent qualities of a true emanation.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s hard to tell if an emanation is real. This is why the commission of ancient Anabaptists resides in the cathedral’s great hall, weighing and gauging their brothers’ and sisters tales. Those who are called before this Council of Emanations are questioned for days. The Council takes its job seriously, for the emanations are seen as proof of the proximity to God and thus determine rank within the Cult.</p>\n<p>With every new emanation, the Council listens a little bit more intently, exploring the soul of the enlightened one. The visions grow to become multilayered and contain mystical symbols, the existence of which is only known to Council members and the Baptists.

The first reports were found in the African outback and were penned by the Libyan. He was a merchant, a shrewd accountant and very enterprising. He catered for the survivors and thus wove the network of contacts that would support him until the end. His trading posts along the African Mediterranean coast were like seeds that soon sprouted into strong cities. One of them was Tripol: according to history the Libyan’s home village started amidst the ruins of ancient Tripoli. Here the streams of commerce met – at least that’s what the books say – and brought unexpected wealth not only to the Libyan: tea, expensive fabrics, oil in amphorae, sacks full of grain, and metalwork piled up in the warehouses and caverns. The ancestral spirits looked favorably upon the city. Tripol blossomed.</p>\n<p>The Libyan’s enterprises had grown too big to be controlled by him alone. The lists dating back to those days count hundreds of packers, helping hands, and scribes, some of them former competitors whom the Libyan had vanquished in wars of trade. Other cost items indicate that some of the profit was funneled back to the populace. The Libyan paid for the construction of meeting halls and had workers create fields or fortified canals.

In the archives, sales quotas and profits for every route and concession are recorded, from the first day of use up to the present time.</p>\n<p>On the first day of the first month of a new year, the Bank of Commerce hosts the great auction.

No one can afford to miss the auction. Exactly at high noon, all concessions fall back to the Bank of Commerce.</p>\n<p>The auction takes all day. Offers of coveted and profitable routes alternate with those of risky and undeveloped concessions.

His trading posts along the African Mediterranean coast were like seeds that soon sprouted into strong cities. One of them was Tripol: according to history the Libyan’s home village started amidst the ruins of ancient Tripoli. Here the streams of commerce met – at least that’s what the books say – and brought unexpected wealth not only to the Libyan: tea, expensive fabrics, oil in amphorae, sacks full of grain, and metalwork piled up in the warehouses and caverns. The ancestral spirits looked favorably upon the city. Tripol blossomed.</p>\n<p>The Libyan’s enterprises had grown too big to be controlled by him alone. The lists dating back to those days count hundreds of packers, helping hands, and scribes, some of them former competitors whom the Libyan had vanquished in wars of trade. Other cost items indicate that some of the profit was funneled back to the populace. The Libyan paid for the construction of meeting halls and had workers create fields or fortified canals. Africa’s decline had been stopped.</p>\n<p>Now, its inhabitants prepared to storm a mountain of inherited Cultural waste, Clan enmities, and desolate structures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE FOUNDATION</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵<br />@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.timeline.6j15f1Nl0YjS6WgD.JournalEntryPage.OwNfUSBFi6ZpO0Un#2215-━-the-cult-of-the-neolibyans]{2215}</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Libyan hated every word that did not directly lead to a profit measured in Dinars.

Some in Tripol might find satisfaction in endless columns of numbers, others go aboard ships and travel to Europe. They exchange their finely crafted and delicate rifles for highcaliber guns with telescopic sights, shoving bullet after bullet into their bandoliers and wearing them proudly. It feels heavy around their hips. They are ready. The rounds of their rifles hammer across Pollen’s tundra, through Borca’s forests, and across Purgare’s cinder deserts like thunder. Every crack makes mammoths fall or tears apart Gendos. The Neolibyan and his entourage scream in joy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">But they’re only animals. You slaughter animals, you don’t fight them. The true challenge, the proof of their superiority, lurks deep inside the spore fields. Screaming Dushani stealing a piece of your soul with every step you approach them, Pheromancers luring you close and pressing their hot flesh against yours to turn you into a soulless puppet, Psychokinetics who appear in front of you a thousandfold in the kaleidoscope of a fracturing space, commanding swarms of ticks: This is where you’ll find worthy game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The most exalted of all creatures lurking in what the Europeans call the Sepsis is the Biokinetic, whose flesh devours bullet after bullet, developing sores that push the lead out of his body while he keeps advancing on you, groaning and creaking.

Soon, the tempest will wash away any dirt, and the roaring of the water will be the only sound in the jungle for many hours to come.</p>\n<p>Before us is another building. The painted plaster has fallen from the mud bricks in large areas. But the image of the dark figure with the great muscles and the angry look can still be easily seen due to its size.

The drawing next to it shows the dark figure – the African – gloating over the prone white man and grabbing his whip. There is one image after the other.</p>\n<p>The Scourge now cuts glowing lines into its former owner’s body.

They expect a lot of them: not only to defend the land, but also to safeguard its traditions against the ravages of time. Whenever an African is caught lying, has done some damage to another African, or even needs to move a rock to build his hut, the Scourgers are called in. The Scourgers decide in the spirit of the traditions, and they decide quickly. Liars may not speak until the good spirits of the village send a sign, those who have caused damage to others have to repair that damage, even if they must do so by their own hands’ work, the rock may only be moved if no one in the village opposes the idea and the spirit inhabiting the rock has been pacified with sacrifices for a whole month.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>WARUI</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Swahili, Arabic, Hausa, Malinke, Kikongo, Amharic, Somali, and thousands of other languages were spoken in Africa, some by populations of hundreds of millions, others by a few dozen people on the brink of extinction.

The people lost their fathers’ tongue and communicated on a rudimentary level with simple words, clicks, and other basic sounds. This new language formed images in the minds of its users, conveying a painful intensity of emotions with few phonemes. The Scourgers call it Warui, meaning “from the river”. They consider it the legacy of the eight ancestors who pierced the barrier by interfering with the human world and making way for a flood of emotions and ancient knowledge. Those who drink from this river are rid of the intellectual ballast of centuries, of grammar and vocabulary, and regain the first and most primordial of all languages in which the spirits and ancestors communicate with the Africans.</p>\n<p>Without the Warui, the Scourgers hailing from villages and cities all over Africa could never have joined together. In battle, it unites the warriors’ souls in a way that is far beyond human language.</p>\n<p>But in the cold north, the ancestors’ influence diminishes, and so does the strength of the Warui.

To deny him would mean offending the ancestors. However, there are limits to what a Scourger can demand. If he’s thought to be immoderate – hoarding riches or demanding gifts that he doesn’t need to do his job, for example – his brothers and sisters take care of him. Quickly, and without much ado. Wherever he may indulge these debaucheries, be it at a Neolibyan’s table or in a brothel’s bed, they grab him and drag him away, kicking and screaming.

When equipped with a cage on the bed, they are perfectly suited for hunting – humans or animals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Many Scourgers also train hyenas that can track enemies in areas where Koms cannot maneuver. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Just like at the Neolibyan’s table, a Scourger has to be modest in battle: a Hybrispanian village full of old people, women, and children will not be subjected to a softeningup barrage, but attacked with spears, a boar will not be killed from a distance, but attacked with a knife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> For the Scourgers, fighting means a battle between souls and a trial of strength.

There’s a tingle that runs through the body, the breath quickens, and gibberish floods the mind. They have accomplished something. They feel to the core of their being.</p>\n<p>Every ancestor plucks the string of life in his own special way, and every ancestor appears alone. The emotions he triggers jump from person to person and spread like a bubble. The people are carried by the wave: at the epicenter, the emotions smash the walls of reason and determine the people’s thoughts, emotions, and actions.</p>\n<p>A few hundred paces further out, the effects fade. The emotions sink to the subconscious. They guide without resulting in full turns. Days later, the influence fades completely or is replaced by other emotions, another ancestor.</p>\n<p>Scourgers and Anubians are especially sensitive to this. While Anubians lower their gaze in silent meditation, the Scourgers become inspired and exercise every aspect of the ancestor. They don’t know his name: the eight ancestors come from a time and sphere that has no room for words, only emotions and conflation as experienced today in the Warui or in dreams, nowhere else. To discuss these ancestors, one has to choose the roundabout way, talking about their aspects or using metaphors.</p>\n<p>The first ancestor is often characterized as an eagle. He soars above everything, broadening his gaze to the horizon of his own being, but also taking in his surroundings. He strengthens intuition and gives hints of the future.</p>\n<p>The second ancestor embodies the strength and superiority of the Lion. If this ancestor comes over a region, the people square their shoulders, compete with one another in duels, and take on any challenge.</p>\n<p>The third ancestor is like earth in one’s hand, like a wall crumbling to dust because of a thought, like an earthquake. He manifests in the form of creative energy and of physical and mental exhaustion. Under his influence, great works of art and giant buildings are created.</p>\n<p>The fourth ancestor opens people’s hearts. He is community and love. Joining on a spiritual level, he tears down barriers.</p>\n<p>The fifth ancestor is pure physical desire, colliding bodies that have only one goal: sexual reproduction. The sixth ancestor blows like a clear thought through the minds of the affected. The thousand layers of communication with their meta-meanings and lies crumble until only one layer remains. Every word is understood as intended. Every thought is a blazing star rising in the thinker’s mind.</p>\n<p>The seventh ancestor only appears where at least two ancestors’ influences collide. He superimposes them and unites their aspects. The Scourgers see him as the source of Warui.</p>\n<p>The eighth ancestor is the shadow cast by the other sevens’ light. He overwhelms and oppresses. His teeth and thorns catch every thought. People under his influence who may have been open-minded and friendly a moment ago suddenly act subversively and only for their own gain. But the Africans accept it without complaint. Their world has always been full of good and evil spirits: both are a part of the order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>UNTO DEATH</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nBeing a Scourger is not a birthright, but great deeds do not help a young African to become part of the warrior caste, either. It’s a mother’s sole decision: no amount of complaining will help if she thinks that a Neolibyan would be good for the family. Many a boy flees into the jungle looking for a Scourger pack willing to take him in. But no, if the child is not handed over by the mother herself, the warriors chase them away. <br /><br />Once a Scourger, he has to prove himself worthy at the age of 12. In the vicinity of Gibraltar, he will have to hunt down a freed slave. In Tripol, he will be abandoned in the jungle to confront wild animals, equipped only with a spear. The rites of acceptance vary from place to place, but they are all life-threatening. The applicant should not expect anyone to help. Even if a slave bashes his head in, the Scourgers will not interfere. Either the ancestors elect the child and lend their strength to the applicant, or not. If not, maybe they would’ve been better off as a Scrapper or Neolibyan after all. <br /><br />After this trial, the child is presented as a Scourger in his home village. Now he can draw on the Neolibyans. <br /><br />Between the age of 12 and 28, all Scourgers are cared for by their village’s community. These adolescents and adults may not marry: their deaths would cause existential problems for their partners. Of course, this does not stop them from having purely sexual relationships. <br /><br />After the age of 28 and a rite of passage, they swear to use their heads more and their fists less. They are now considered elders. They still fight, but now they act from the background and are now more responsible for planning missions. Older Scourgers may marry, but are fully liable for their partners and children. The Neolibyans are only obligated to take care of the warrior himself, not any of their hangers-on. The Scourger may still not work, though. Usually the profit from the selling of slaves to Neolibyan plantations guarantees suitable life with two to three partners for them. But they never get away from the fighting. <br /><br />At the age of about 50 – a foggy line, because many Scourgers stop counting the years once they become elders – they are considered sages. They lead their villages, passing judgment or entering a permanent liaison with their ancestors as shamans or hermits. Their numbers are few. The calmer years as an elder do not make up for the stressful life as a warrior. <br /><br />Not many reach the age of 45.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"CIWQZLE8LyfjkiH6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/cultcard_scourgers.png","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;height:120px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:71px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px;height:71px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>A white man’s warrior clan, guardians of Purgare and Southern Borca.

But those who accept it find salvation through insight. This insight can take many forms. To understand and transcend it takes a whole lifetime. According to the Neognosis, God and the world are opposites on a large scale, while mind and matter are opposed on a small scale. Once, both principles were separate: God’s breath, the Pneuma, was clear and good, matter was dark and bad. It was the Demiurge who mixed two opposites and thus sealed his fate and the fate of the world. Humans are pure divine breath caught in a prison of flesh. The Neognosis describes the body as corrupt and dirty, and this is how Anabaptists see and treat it, too. Only death breaks open this prison, allows the Pneuma to flow out and rejoin the source: absolute knowledge. But between death and the reunion with God, there is a long drift through nothing riddled with chunks of decaying matter. An unenlightened soul wanders aimlessly, gets stuck easily and devolves into a new physical incarnation.

Didn’t people become unbalanced and hectic when they were exposed to the miasma of cities like the terrible Exalt? When they were ill, didn’t they reek of decay and pus?

Around it, even the heretic Bygones would have noticed God’s greatness and felt inspired to do great things.</p>\n<p>When they were riding through the wild wheat of the river Rain one day with the ears of wheat caressing their legs, their breath caught. In the haze, they saw a giant tower, a cathedral. So often had they passed this spot, lost in thought or in conversation with each other. They had harvested the Rain wheat and sowed it in faraway regions. But that day, the cathedral seemed to them like a hint of God.</p>\n<p>The insight hit them as cold as mountain water, and they stood and stared. The Demiurge must have stricken them with blindness and ignorance for centuries. They sank to the ground and buried their hands into the soil, rubbing the wheat straw and inhaling its scent.

The cathedral at its banks would become the center of their faith as it had attracted pious people ages ago.</p>\n<p>But the building was afflicted with heretics and other vile people.

Rebus’ host dug wells and caverns to collect water and built aqueducts to channel it to the fields. They cultivated the wild wheat and sowed the city’s surroundings with it. The aqueduct artery grew.

We are your family, your life and death. The former farmers call themselves the Ascetics. Those amongst them who go to sleep with the Neognosis and awake again with a quick prayer on the lips detest the body as a carnal burden caught in sin. They work the land to help Paradise shake off its rigor mortis – only when the soil is strong will it be able to feed Rebus’ fighters in the final battle. Only late at night, when the muscles ache and the body gets weak, do they retreat to their chambers and give thanks for the work they are allowed to do. They dissociate themselves from their bodies through pain and meditation to finally break their chains and become one with the Pneuma. They suppress physical needs as if they were a blemish sent by the Demiurge.

Additionally, the community has a place for everyone, be it as an Ascetic working the land or as an Orgiastic on the battlefield. There comes a time when everyone has to prove his worth. <br /><br />In the first year, Cathedral City pairs the Touched Ones with a senior Anabaptist who serves as a confessor and guide. He teaches his Touched One the basics of the Neognosis and how to recognize friends and enemies of the Cult. The Touched is the Anabaptist’s lackey, helping him get dressed and performing menial tasks.<br /><br />In his spare time, the new arrival explores Cathedral City or the Anabaptist camp in which his mentor is stationed. For days or weeks, he joins Orgiastic gangs or toils with the Ascetics in the fields. He has not pledged his life to the Cult yet and can leave his current service at any time to explore another aspect of the community the next day. But he should not expect the Anabaptists’ patience to be boundless. He has at most one season to come to terms with himself: Where does he stand? How does he intend to gain insight? Does he want to liberate his mind through excesses and risk his life in battle against the Demiurge’s monsters, or does he want to gain entrance to heaven through hard work? <br /><br />One last time, he chooses a gang, though he remains with this one until the end of his days. His new brothers and sisters embrace and kiss him and lead him to his quarters.

Without a modicum of Neognostic devotion, an Ascetic remains on the fields and an Orgiastic on the front.</p>\n<p>Those who want more start searching for the Seed. It’s a little thing, but if you water it, it grows to be something bigger that produces new seeds. This is how Rebus described his first divine insight, which led to many more. Seeds require hard work, however, just like a garden doesn’t thrive without the investment of energy. Only those who question themselves on a daily basis and try to see the big things in the small things will feel the Seed within them and be able to make it sprout – to partake in divine emanations.</p>\n<p>The emanations are individual, and every devoted Anabaptist would be well advised to explore them in his mind. For some they are glaring visions, others believe to hear voices, and then there are those who feel an undefined mental change within their soul, as if they were keyed to a divine pole like a compass needle. Most reach this state during their days of hard work or seemingly lost battles, when heart and lungs pump and the enemies’ hot blood is still running from their fists. Some take a shortcut and invent visions. They should be as cryptic as possible: giant stones, a blood-soaked sky, hands reaching down from the clouds, burying themselves in Paradise’s heaving body. There are frauds, but their descriptions often lack the excited passion and transcendent qualities of a true emanation.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s hard to tell if an emanation is real. This is why the commission of ancient Anabaptists resides in the cathedral’s great hall, weighing and gauging their brothers’ and sisters tales. Those who are called before this Council of Emanations are questioned for days. The Council takes its job seriously, for the emanations are seen as proof of the proximity to God and thus determine rank within the Cult.</p>\n<p>With every new emanation, the Council listens a little bit more intently, exploring the soul of the enlightened one. The visions grow to become multilayered and contain mystical symbols, the existence of which is only known to Council members and the Baptists.

He saw the Eshaton as a revelation, the last act of mercy of an angry God. He revealed the illusion of a perfect world as a Demiurgic veil, tore it away and opened up the view of the old Paradise. It lay in front of the humans, torn. The ground was burnt and poisoned, waiting for honest hands’ work. Rebus led, and his host followed.

The land thrived.</p>\n<p>The message spread. At first, there were only a few who begged for a fistful of grain and received it. But Rebus had underestimated the magnetism of his newly awakened paradise. Like locusts, famished skeletons attacked the fruits of the fields, eating until their bellies were fat and rounded and they could only crawl and grunt. However, they did not stop eating, striking down the workers, biting them, fighting for torn-out arms and gnawing at fingers.Rebus’ host had always been working the fields with the stamina of horses, but now they behaved like children when they had to raise their hoes against the devourers.</p>\n<p>That had to change. Rebus armed them with pitchforks, pikes, and spades, and had them attack scarecrows until they were able to handle their farmers’ tools like the weapons of a warrior.</p>\n<p>Years later, the farmers were aided by a caste of warriors blocking every attack with a wall of spades.</p>\n<p>In spite of all the skirmishes and the drills, Rebus’ host kept very much in touch with the people.

It’s just there. Every being, every stone is part of the reality it describes. Those who ignore it get caught blindly and happily in the Demiurge’s tentacles. But those who accept it find salvation through insight. This insight can take many forms. To understand and transcend it takes a whole lifetime. According to the Neognosis, God and the world are opposites on a large scale, while mind and matter are opposed on a small scale. Once, both principles were separate: God’s breath, the Pneuma, was clear and good, matter was dark and bad. It was the Demiurge who mixed two opposites and thus sealed his fate and the fate of the world. Humans are pure divine breath caught in a prison of flesh. The Neognosis describes the body as corrupt and dirty, and this is how Anabaptists see and treat it, too. Only death breaks open this prison, allows the Pneuma to flow out and rejoin the source: absolute knowledge. But between death and the reunion with God, there is a long drift through nothing riddled with chunks of decaying matter. An unenlightened soul wanders aimlessly, gets stuck easily and devolves into a new physical incarnation. Anabaptists teach contemplation in life to find the way to enlightenment in death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE FOUR RIVERS OF PARADISE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">There are four rivers in Paradise: Perat, Hiddekel, Gihon, and Pischon.

He could not leave yet, even if death promised salvation. It was too early!

Didn’t people become unbalanced and hectic when they were exposed to the miasma of cities like the terrible Exalt? When they were ill, didn’t they reek of decay and pus? Rebus ground seeds and pips, experimented with herbs, had the concoctions massaged into his body.

The oil sank into the skin and mixed with their fluids. It cleared their gaze and gave them hope. No longer did they grieve for the upcoming loss, now they euphorically waited for their teacher and leader to become one with the Lord.

Around it, even the heretic Bygones would have noticed God’s greatness and felt inspired to do great things.</p>\n<p>When they were riding through the wild wheat of the river Rain one day with the ears of wheat caressing their legs, their breath caught. In the haze, they saw a giant tower, a cathedral. So often had they passed this spot, lost in thought or in conversation with each other. They had harvested the Rain wheat and sowed it in faraway regions. But that day, the cathedral seemed to them like a hint of God.</p>\n<p>The insight hit them as cold as mountain water, and they stood and stared. The Demiurge must have stricken them with blindness and ignorance for centuries. They sank to the ground and buried their hands into the soil, rubbing the wheat straw and inhaling its scent. Gihon or Hiddekel, Pischon or Perat, this had to be one of the headstreams! The cathedral at its banks would become the center of their faith as it had attracted pious people ages ago.</p>\n<p>But the building was afflicted with heretics and other vile people. A technology Cult calling themselves the Chroniclers had dug deep into the catacombs. Whatever they were doing down there, it surely helped the Demiurge rather than the Lord. Thousands of Neognostics armed with war spades and picks marched against an enemy that a dozen could have vanquished.</p>\n<p>That day, the Chroniclers suffered a defeat that they would never recover from, but for Rebus’ host the liberation was just one of many successful skirmishes.</p>\n<p>The host had been fragmented into several congregations, but now their religious lives became more centered. Rebus’ host dug wells and caverns to collect water and built aqueducts to channel it to the fields. They cultivated the wild wheat and sowed the city’s surroundings with it. The aqueduct artery grew.

Does he want to liberate his mind through excesses and risk his life in battle against the Demiurge’s monsters, or does he want to gain entrance to heaven through hard work? <br /><br />One last time, he chooses a gang, though he remains with this one until the end of his days.

Most reach this state during their days of hard work or seemingly lost battles, when heart and lungs pump and the enemies’ hot blood is still running from their fists. Some take a shortcut and invent visions. They should be as cryptic as possible: giant stones, a blood-soaked sky, hands reaching down from the clouds, burying themselves in Paradise’s heaving body.

Amos is said to have raged. Since then, the Fragment has been living in the cathedral as a guest. Modus is said to roam the archives together with Baptist Orphid, inspecting the documents that the Chroniclers left behind centuries ago. Once per day, Modus shows up on the steps of the cathedral to prove that he’s alive and has the right to hospitality. As long as this applies, there is peace between Anabaptists and Chroniclers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Jehammedans are a different case. Their demeanor, their cleanliness, their precisely shaved beards, and their starched garments expose the Anabaptists’ own crudeness. The Orgiastics repaid that arrogance a thousand fold: they killed their goat herds, dragged Abramis from tents, pushed them into the dirt, and shaved them clean with their swords. Hagaris and Saraelis were raped. The hatred has deepened the trenches between them to a bottomless hell over the centuries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">In the Adriatic basin, however, where the eons-old battle began, something new is rising. In the fight against the Jehammedans from the Balkhan, the Anabaptists converted the majority of the Purgans and built large fortresses along the river Adria. A year ago, heavily armed troops manned those bulky fortresses while the cries and moans of the wounded in the giant sick bay cities echoed across the basin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">But now, the Anabaptists’ sword arm has become just as heavy as the Jehammedans’. They still curse each other, but no one risks an attack for fear it might enrage the enemy and provoke a bloody counterattack. Still, the Adriatic remains a powder keg with a short fuse.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":100000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"O1W1gJInb3IZPzzt","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/cultcard_anabaptists.png","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ANUBIANS</h3>\n<p>They look for divinity in stones and trees, talk to bugs, and surround themselves with bones and death.

There had to be a counterbalancing force he had come close to over the years, the force that filled his mind with crisp freshness and kept him going yet had still remained intangible.</p>\n<p>In the thicket of pagan faiths he finally found something called Neognosis. It was the tree in the Garden of Eden, it was the apple and the snake.

It lay in front of the humans, torn. The ground was burnt and poisoned, waiting for honest hands’ work. Rebus led, and his host followed.

But those who accept it find salvation through insight. This insight can take many forms. To understand and transcend it takes a whole lifetime. According to the Neognosis, God and the world are opposites on a large scale, while mind and matter are opposed on a small scale. Once, both principles were separate: God’s breath, the Pneuma, was clear and good, matter was dark and bad. It was the Demiurge who mixed two opposites and thus sealed his fate and the fate of the world. Humans are pure divine breath caught in a prison of flesh. The Neognosis describes the body as corrupt and dirty, and this is how Anabaptists see and treat it, too. Only death breaks open this prison, allows the Pneuma to flow out and rejoin the source: absolute knowledge. But between death and the reunion with God, there is a long drift through nothing riddled with chunks of decaying matter. An unenlightened soul wanders aimlessly, gets stuck easily and devolves into a new physical incarnation.

Didn’t people become unbalanced and hectic when they were exposed to the miasma of cities like the terrible Exalt? When they were ill, didn’t they reek of decay and pus? Rebus ground seeds and pips, experimented with herbs, had the concoctions massaged into his body.

The oil sank into the skin and mixed with their fluids. It cleared their gaze and gave them hope. No longer did they grieve for the upcoming loss, now they euphorically waited for their teacher and leader to become one with the Lord.

Around it, even the heretic Bygones would have noticed God’s greatness and felt inspired to do great things.</p>\n<p>When they were riding through the wild wheat of the river Rain one day with the ears of wheat caressing their legs, their breath caught. In the haze, they saw a giant tower, a cathedral. So often had they passed this spot, lost in thought or in conversation with each other. They had harvested the Rain wheat and sowed it in faraway regions. But that day, the cathedral seemed to them like a hint of God.</p>\n<p>The insight hit them as cold as mountain water, and they stood and stared. The Demiurge must have stricken them with blindness and ignorance for centuries. They sank to the ground and buried their hands into the soil, rubbing the wheat straw and inhaling its scent. Gihon or Hiddekel, Pischon or Perat, this had to be one of the headstreams! The cathedral at its banks would become the center of their faith as it had attracted pious people ages ago.</p>\n<p>But the building was afflicted with heretics and other vile people. A technology Cult calling themselves the Chroniclers had dug deep into the catacombs. Whatever they were doing down there, it surely helped the Demiurge rather than the Lord. Thousands of Neognostics armed with war spades and picks marched against an enemy that a dozen could have vanquished.</p>\n<p>That day, the Chroniclers suffered a defeat that they would never recover from, but for Rebus’ host the liberation was just one of many successful skirmishes.</p>\n<p>The host had been fragmented into several congregations, but now their religious lives became more centered. Rebus’ host dug wells and caverns to collect water and built aqueducts to channel it to the fields. They cultivated the wild wheat and sowed the city’s surroundings with it. The aqueduct artery grew.

Without a modicum of Neognostic devotion, an Ascetic remains on the fields and an Orgiastic on the front.</p>\n<p>Those who want more start searching for the Seed. It’s a little thing, but if you water it, it grows to be something bigger that produces new seeds. This is how Rebus described his first divine insight, which led to many more. Seeds require hard work, however, just like a garden doesn’t thrive without the investment of energy. Only those who question themselves on a daily basis and try to see the big things in the small things will feel the Seed within them and be able to make it sprout – to partake in divine emanations.</p>\n<p>The emanations are individual, and every devoted Anabaptist would be well advised to explore them in his mind. For some they are glaring visions, others believe to hear voices, and then there are those who feel an undefined mental change within their soul, as if they were keyed to a divine pole like a compass needle. Most reach this state during their days of hard work or seemingly lost battles, when heart and lungs pump and the enemies’ hot blood is still running from their fists. Some take a shortcut and invent visions. They should be as cryptic as possible: giant stones, a blood-soaked sky, hands reaching down from the clouds, burying themselves in Paradise’s heaving body. There are frauds, but their descriptions often lack the excited passion and transcendent qualities of a true emanation.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s hard to tell if an emanation is real. This is why the commission of ancient Anabaptists resides in the cathedral’s great hall, weighing and gauging their brothers’ and sisters tales. Those who are called before this Council of Emanations are questioned for days. The Council takes its job seriously, for the emanations are seen as proof of the proximity to God and thus determine rank within the Cult.</p>\n<p>With every new emanation, the Council listens a little bit more intently, exploring the soul of the enlightened one. The visions grow to become multilayered and contain mystical symbols, the existence of which is only known to Council members and the Baptists. In the end, only true believers or the truly cunning can reach the Cult’s top.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>RICH ON EMANATIONS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The eight most insightful Anabaptists rank higher than even the Council.

The Exalter Clan claimed the city as part of its heritage, and the population opened up the gates without much deliberation. They even cheered the invaders. The Anabaptists remained calm. In fact, they did not understand what was happening there, and thought that the hubbub was a fun affair. When they realized that they had just witnessed the conquering of the city, it was already too late. Now, Emissaries travel to and fro between Liqua, Cathedral City, and Justitian as though Liqua were the most important spot in the world.

The Initiates move on the outmost Circle, the Enchanters on the sixth one, the Embalmers, Sickles, and Healers on the fifth. The honorable Hogons have left the four outer Circles behind and stand on the third one. They decide when an Anubian is ready to leave his Circle.t sand long ago, they hoped for their awakening.

Their thorns are hard as glass; one scratch is enough to make necrotic abscesses bloat the skin, eating away at the flesh within minutes until they reach the bone, infecting it, growing through it until it collapses and breaks under the weight of the decaying flesh. The ripe fruit and lush leaves are just as dangerous. Within, they are compartmentalized in hundreds of chambers with crystalline walls. Every chamber is filled with epigenetically active substances. When they come in contact with human cells, they cause genetic aberrations leading to a spontaneous dying of the cells, the so-called Raze. The mutation jumps from cell to cell, spreading extremely fast. The infected organism decays in minutes. There is no cure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The only exceptions are the seeds used by Europe’s Scourgers. Bitten in two, they break into a thousand splinters that enter the gums and the mucosae like glass. They don’t kill, but strengthen the Warui outside of Africa. Their effects are not generated in the stomach or the guts, but via the blood. The Anubians are almost immune to the Raze. The thorns still cause festering wounds, but the high-ranking Hogons can heal them within hours. The Anubians’ blood reacts with the Psychovore poisons, binding them and creating synergetic compounds. This leads to super cells that flood the organism. They synthesize proteins that in turn react catalytically to other Psychovore substances. The Anubian body turns into a bioreactor the complexity of which grows with every added substance: a Spitalian would barely recognize an Anubian blood sample in this phase as human. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Anubians use this to their advantage. They venture deep into the Psychovores to harvest the cherished Duat fruit, smash them, and chew the pieces. The Raze eats away at their mucosae and cheeks, but the cells are reanimated only seconds later. The poison drags them into Anubis’s realm. Their immune system collapses. Blackness runs through their veins and trickles into the flesh like running paint. In the first minutes of transition, their blood degenerates to a highly toxic concoction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">They die. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">They stand in front of the jackal-headed one, placing their soul onto the balance of his scales. In the shadows, they feel Ammit, the devourer of souls. They stare into eyes that are cold and deep as stellar mists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The bioreactor kicks in. The body vibrates from heat. The heart pounds and circulates the seething blood. A honey-like ichor wells from glands under the tongue, in the armpits, and in the groin. The body’s blackness disappears. They are grabbed, torn away from Anubis’s throne, come back into life wincing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Depending on the potency of the Duat fruit, the rigor mortis has taken minutes or days. Some Anubians become covered in the Psychovores as if in a cocoon, having to free themselves from brittle loops. Their blood is now highly potent. Drained and mixed with earth and herbs it can heal, soothe pain, or stimulate body and spirit. With time, Anubians learn the properties their blood has gained through the catalysis of various Duat fruits.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ANANSI SPIDERS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Thousands of red figures scuttle across the planes or dive into Anubis’s grass seas: the red Anansi spiders, hairless and fistsized.

They forgot their own culture. Even today, remainders of the Anubian Thread of Life can be found in the descendants of North Africans, Asians, and sometimes even the Europeans – and the Anubians look for these cast off strands. To find them, the Cult uses the Finger of Anubis, a hollow bone artfully adorned with circular and spiral engravings the length of the forearm, tapering to a fine point at the tip. These bones are rare, passed on from Anubian to Anubian, generation to generation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">According to legend, the bone is filled with jackal bile.

He bandages the deceased and guides them into the afterlife. In the sixth and seventh Circles, an Anubian is shrouded in mysticism and superstition.

Yet he still presents himself to the people as a spiritual healer, bargaining with Anubis for the life of the ill.<br /><br />When he takes the sickle and becomes an Ammit, he lets go of all rites that avail to nothing. As a warrior and guardian, he only knows action and reaction, listening to the ancestors and feeling the pull of the glaring Psychonaut Chakras. When speaking with the Scourgers, he will claim to protect the wave of creation. <br /><br />As an Embalmer, and in his next transformation as a Soul Seer, he uses the superstition. He is judge and counselor, leads villages and guides Africa’s war efforts. The Psychovores part for him and enclose his enemies. He can shut out the whispering of some of the ancestors and make room for others – not because he prays or meditates, but because he has understood the principle. Because he’s the key and the Psychovores are the lock. The people believe that ancestral spirits accompany him to pay their debts to Anubis. They believe that the spirits imbue the Psychovores. He lets them believe whatever they want to. <br /><br />The last transformation before the transition to Cairo is the Hogon. He’s far removed from his roots as a reborn Anubian. When he hands out the canopic jars, he watches the transformation. He has been present at hundreds of them and has seen the physical changes during every single one of them. Sure, those changes were few, and meaningless in and of themselves. Fingers became thinner or more delicate, hair became darker, eyebrows became thinner or moved a tiny bit. <br /><br />He’s in contact with the Spitalians and discusses these phenomena with them. How could he speak out against the white doctors for the last decades? What a lack of knowledge! Aside from the Anubians, no one is closer to the secrets than them. <br /><br />He also recognizes the circular tattoo on his belly for what it is: an indicator for the transformation. The molecules induced by the paint react to epigenetic transformation. Only when it is successful are these molecules destroyed and the Circle vanishes. <br /><br />But why? <br /><br />Why adapt? <br /><br />The next transformation brings him a little closer to the truth. <br /><br />Only two Circles to go.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE SICKLE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nAnubians feel Psychonauts at a distance of many hundreds of meters: they experience the Aberrant’s presence as a malaise. <br /><br />When a Dushani approaches the Anubian clutches his aching throat, when a Pregnoctic approaches he feels a burning pain between the eyebrows. <br /><br />The Psychonautic Chakra, the blazing star on the body’s axis, changes an Anubian’s Chakra to a dying planet.

When the deceased’s soul finally reached the realm of the dead, it had to prove itself to Osiris and his 42 demonic assistants. If it was considered sinful, Ammit devoured the soul’s Ba. If it was considered worthy, though, it reached the celestial realm of the fields of Yaru. There, the corn was strong in the fields, and life was as it had been when the person was alive. <br /><br />The Egyptians copied this practice from the Anubians.

Legend has it that only Anubis himself was able to decipher the script, and he was also the one to read it to Osiris and his demons. If the passages pleased the God of the underworld, he had the books sent to Yaru along with the spirit. However, if Osiris grew bored or angry from hearing the spirits deeds, he destroyed the writings with a simple gesture. Afterwards, even Anubis could not decipher them anymore. <br /><br />Anubians retrieve books of the dead from the vaults of the first people.

It is said that only Anubians with one or no Circles know what to make of them, but it is also said that the books will only open and talk to the Anubians once Anubis walks amongst the living again. <br /><br />The Hogons gaze upon those who own books of the dead favorably. For you don’t just find these books – they let themselves be found.

They forgot their own culture. Even today, remainders of the Anubian Thread of Life can be found in the descendants of North Africans, Asians, and sometimes even the Europeans – and the Anubians look for these cast off strands.

Their thorns are hard as glass; one scratch is enough to make necrotic abscesses bloat the skin, eating away at the flesh within minutes until they reach the bone, infecting it, growing through it until it collapses and breaks under the weight of the decaying flesh. The ripe fruit and lush leaves are just as dangerous. Within, they are compartmentalized in hundreds of chambers with crystalline walls. Every chamber is filled with epigenetically active substances. When they come in contact with human cells, they cause genetic aberrations leading to a spontaneous dying of the cells, the so-called Raze. The mutation jumps from cell to cell, spreading extremely fast. The infected organism decays in minutes. There is no cure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The only exceptions are the seeds used by Europe’s Scourgers. Bitten in two, they break into a thousand splinters that enter the gums and the mucosae like glass. They don’t kill, but strengthen the Warui outside of Africa. Their effects are not generated in the stomach or the guts, but via the blood. The Anubians are almost immune to the Raze. The thorns still cause festering wounds, but the high-ranking Hogons can heal them within hours. The Anubians’ blood reacts with the Psychovore poisons, binding them and creating synergetic compounds. This leads to super cells that flood the organism. They synthesize proteins that in turn react catalytically to other Psychovore substances. The Anubian body turns into a bioreactor the complexity of which grows with every added substance: a Spitalian would barely recognize an Anubian blood sample in this phase as human. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Anubians use this to their advantage. They venture deep into the Psychovores to harvest the cherished Duat fruit, smash them, and chew the pieces. The Raze eats away at their mucosae and cheeks, but the cells are reanimated only seconds later. The poison drags them into Anubis’s realm. Their immune system collapses. Blackness runs through their veins and trickles into the flesh like running paint. In the first minutes of transition, their blood degenerates to a highly toxic concoction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">They die. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">They stand in front of the jackal-headed one, placing their soul onto the balance of his scales.

They stare into eyes that are cold and deep as stellar mists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The bioreactor kicks in. The body vibrates from heat. The heart pounds and circulates the seething blood. A honey-like ichor wells from glands under the tongue, in the armpits, and in the groin. The body’s blackness disappears. They are grabbed, torn away from Anubis’s throne, come back into life wincing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Depending on the potency of the Duat fruit, the rigor mortis has taken minutes or days. Some Anubians become covered in the Psychovores as if in a cocoon, having to free themselves from brittle loops. Their blood is now highly potent. Drained and mixed with earth and herbs it can heal, soothe pain, or stimulate body and spirit. With time, Anubians learn the properties their blood has gained through the catalysis of various Duat fruits.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ANANSI SPIDERS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Thousands of red figures scuttle across the planes or dive into Anubis’s grass seas: the red Anansi spiders, hairless and fistsized.

No one dares to resist the Anubian or deny him anything. An Initiate becomes an Enchanter after his first transformation. He names the price the spirits of the forests and plains can ask for their benevolent behavior. He guides the Scourgers so they can fulfill their task as guardians of the traditions. He bandages the deceased and guides them into the afterlife. In the sixth and seventh Circles, an Anubian is shrouded in mysticism and superstition. He adorns himself with skulls, draws spirals and circles on his body, lives in a hut of bones just like his predecessor. In the scarab he sees divine power of creation, he carves Uschebtis figurines from alabaster in preparation for the burial rites. He moves in tune with the people, listens to the whispering of the ancestors, and meditates.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>OSSUARIES</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The African people simultaneously worship and fear the Anubians.

As a Healer and later as a Hecatean, he gains more and more of an empirical mind, becoming someone who looks for Duat fruit and catalyzes them. Yet he still presents himself to the people as a spiritual healer, bargaining with Anubis for the life of the ill.<br /><br />When he takes the sickle and becomes an Ammit, he lets go of all rites that avail to nothing. As a warrior and guardian, he only knows action and reaction, listening to the ancestors and feeling the pull of the glaring Psychonaut Chakras. When speaking with the Scourgers, he will claim to protect the wave of creation. <br /><br />As an Embalmer, and in his next transformation as a Soul Seer, he uses the superstition. He is judge and counselor, leads villages and guides Africa’s war efforts. The Psychovores part for him and enclose his enemies. He can shut out the whispering of some of the ancestors and make room for others – not because he prays or meditates, but because he has understood the principle. Because he’s the key and the Psychovores are the lock. The people believe that ancestral spirits accompany him to pay their debts to Anubis. They believe that the spirits imbue the Psychovores. He lets them believe whatever they want to. <br /><br />The last transformation before the transition to Cairo is the Hogon. He’s far removed from his roots as a reborn Anubian. When he hands out the canopic jars, he watches the transformation. He has been present at hundreds of them and has seen the physical changes during every single one of them. Sure, those changes were few, and meaningless in and of themselves. Fingers became thinner or more delicate, hair became darker, eyebrows became thinner or moved a tiny bit. <br /><br />He’s in contact with the Spitalians and discusses these phenomena with them. How could he speak out against the white doctors for the last decades? What a lack of knowledge! Aside from the Anubians, no one is closer to the secrets than them. <br /><br />He also recognizes the circular tattoo on his belly for what it is: an indicator for the transformation. The molecules induced by the paint react to epigenetic transformation. Only when it is successful are these molecules destroyed and the Circle vanishes. <br /><br />But why? <br /><br />Why adapt? <br /><br />The next transformation brings him a little closer to the truth. <br /><br />Only two Circles to go.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE SICKLE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nAnubians feel Psychonauts at a distance of many hundreds of meters: they experience the Aberrant’s presence as a malaise. <br /><br />When a Dushani approaches the Anubian clutches his aching throat, when a Pregnoctic approaches he feels a burning pain between the eyebrows. <br /><br />The Psychonautic Chakra, the blazing star on the body’s axis, changes an Anubian’s Chakra to a dying planet. If the Anubian wants to survive, he has to lift up his Khopesh and cut the thread between himself and the Psychonaut at the exit spot in the Aberrant’s body. <br /><br />He parts the flesh where his own pain smolders, drags the blade upwards, following the strands, and pushes the steel back down again. The last inflammatory site is cut open, fear and energies flow out like pus. The Psychonaut collapses, but it’s not the flowing blood that weakens him. The source of his power is leaking and spills into the Aethyr. His heart may still be beating, but his soul has gone. The Anubian, though, is healed.

Somewhere in the misty jungles, mountains, and deserts of Africa, it pulses within the Psychovores. The Anubians are always looking for its sources. <br /><br />They follow ancient drawings on brittle maps, listening to the whisper, letting themselves be guided by it. Usually the wave breaks, and the Anubians have wandered thousands of kilometers into nothing. But sometimes they find stairs leading down. Down into prehistoric vaults, into labyrinths made of glass and polished sandstone. Behind false walls, protected by pitfalls and dead ends, the first people slumber, preserved in beautiful sarcophagi eons old made of gold, lapis lazuli, and chrome. <br /><br />No Anubian with more than two Circles has ever seen one of these ancient ones. It is said that the sarcophagi are indestructible, and only an opening ritual in Cairo can unlock them. The long chain of the Thread of Life is said to be impeccable in them, inscribed into them by Anubis himself. No wrong letter, no errant passage disturbs the perfection. They are like him. In them, he will one day walk the earth. <br /><br />If one of these vaults is found, the Hogons will soon arrive. They take the sarcophagi from their bracings and carry them to a necropolis near to Cairo. They may not, cannot approach any further.

When the deceased’s soul finally reached the realm of the dead, it had to prove itself to Osiris and his 42 demonic assistants. If it was considered sinful, Ammit devoured the soul’s Ba. If it was considered worthy, though, it reached the celestial realm of the fields of Yaru. There, the corn was strong in the fields, and life was as it had been when the person was alive. <br /><br />The Egyptians copied this practice from the Anubians. The books contain the complete listing of the deceased person’s life essence – in a language illegible to the living. Legend has it that only Anubis himself was able to decipher the script, and he was also the one to read it to Osiris and his demons. If the passages pleased the God of the underworld, he had the books sent to Yaru along with the spirit. However, if Osiris grew bored or angry from hearing the spirits deeds, he destroyed the writings with a simple gesture. Afterwards, even Anubis could not decipher them anymore. <br /><br />Anubians retrieve books of the dead from the vaults of the first people. They are made of a deep, matte black material, and each one is massive and cannot be opened – they more closely resemble flat slabs than books. It is said that only Anubians with one or no Circles know what to make of them, but it is also said that the books will only open and talk to the Anubians once Anubis walks amongst the living again. <br /><br />The Hogons gaze upon those who own books of the dead favorably.

What makes an Apocalyptic’s soul shiver is the caress of a perfumed woman or a strong man, cries of passion and of pain, cold power. Bookish knowledge makes them, and one very important part of the body, shrink back.</p>\n<p>The Cult’s roots, though, seem forgotten. What good were they for the Apocalyptics anyway? Should they have learned from them?</p>\n<p>Chroniclers are known for dealing with fun and sexuality like Spitalians do with Psychonauts. Beyond normal life, this gives them a lot of time to sniff around in other people’s affairs. The Cluster has evaluated hundreds of thousands of Stream extracts related to the Apocalyptics over the centuries and added findings of Streamers and Mediators to them. What’s interesting is that they found an inherent structure in this trove of data. Information clustered around blank spots, joining to form a giant puzzle that had to be expanded several times and finally was transferred into an n-dimensional data space. Click! Every day, new data comes in, sticking to the structures or strengthening existing links. The silhouettes of the black spots are higher in contrast than ever before, mocking the Chroniclers and keeping them going until, yes, until … Yes!</p>\n<p>In the beginning, there was Gerome Getrell.</p>\n<p>He was a billionaire, visionary, brilliant orator, and televangelist. He preached the power of the archetypes and of the Tarot, free love and sadism, nationalism and anarchy, democracy and dictatorship, a life on the fast lane, subversion. His Streamcasts made the data paths glow, illuminating the deepest recesses of the Bygone soul. One feed alone generated thousands of interpretations, most of which were founded on Getrell’s paradoxes. Everyone felt he was onto something, a feeling of insight. Getrell’s wisdom promised freedom in an overregulated world to those who were able to decipher the feeds and see the truth between the contradictions.</p>\n<p>Passion over mind was the simplest interpretation.</p>\n<p>Their proponents set forth to shock. They formed gangs that at first were only known for ecstatic parties and orgies, drug abuse, mass brawls, and storming public buildings – a nuisance, but not a danger that couldn’t be handled with truncheons and shockers.</p>\n<p>But the gangs grew, and so did their confidence and ruthlessness. With a fleet of captured drones, they cut a bloody swath through the ranks of established cartels to finally take over the drug market. They discovered prototype mobile factories and produced guns and metal blades for the masses in them. They avoided the security forces, but they didn’t hide. They were free as a bird, and when one of them was shot down, the Flock didn’t care. Wherever they appeared, they sprayed a stylized raven on the wall, the sign of Getrell’s Apocalyptics.</p>\n<p>Getrell never took a stance on this. He never referred to current events. He was above the fray.</p>\n<p>The tree of chaos he had planted continued to produce colorful blossoms, some of them poisonous, some of them wholesome. For there were peaceful offshoots as well: spiritual people who turned their backs on the established religions in disappointment and found inner strength in Getrell’s mystical Tarot.</p>\n<p>He disappeared a few months before the Eshaton. His Stream feeds kept hammering into his disciples’ skulls, but there were no updates. He didn’t tell them what the future held. Journalists looking for him got lost in the thicket of his corporations. He had to be somewhere in there.</p>\n<p>Here, the Chroniclers lose his track.</p>\n<p>His followers stepped up, dominating the Stream almost until it collapsed. At that time, the Apocalyptics were an outlet for many people. Really live just one last time, feel every nuance of your own suffering and joy…</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>FALSE PROPHET</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Streamfeed-Subject: Manipulation</p>\n<p>From: Ammit@hiddenhost</p>\n<p>To: *</p>\n<p>Gerome Getrell did not address you, your wife, your kids, or your neighbors.

No one was prepared for it, not even the Apocalyptics. But their practiced fatalism helped them to see the shimmer of the present in the dark years. They quickly conquered the black markets, placing intermediaries with the UEO soldiers monitoring the reconstruction. Through them, the Apocalyptics got their hands on food, weapons, and filtration systems and stashed them in the ruins. Those who got in the way were bribed, blackmailed, or killed. Drugs, sex, and weapons: the Apocalyptics catered to every market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">With sticks, stones, and automatic weapons, they herded Europe into the era of the beast.

Other groups had started sorting out the chaos and gaining influence. In Borca the First Judge strode through their ranks and carnage ensued, in the Balkhan the Voivodes joined the game for power. The Hellvetics sealed the passes and the ancient smuggler routes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Apocalyptics had to close ranks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Now that they felt besieged on all sides, they remembered Getrell’s Tarot. A card sequence on a table could smooth down differences or give a hint to death. More and more, the archetypal symbols decided the Apocalyptics’ fate, which fostered fortune tellers and mystics amidst the Cult. The Tarot made the Apocalyptics thrive.

The strong ones don’t lead, but the old ones. Fresh blood curdles at the fringes, hoping for recognition. The Apocalyptics are different. They buy or sell children, have them fight the dogs for their food. Everyone gets a chance to prove himself and rise every day. Brawls and knife fights spoil the daily routine, and there is only one rule: fighting fairly means not taking your opponent seriously.</p>\n<p>If a Flock leader shows weakness, he may be attacked. Usually a duel in the dust in front of the tents ensues, consisting of lightning-quick blows and kicks. The Flock roots for the combatants, cheering as they form a circle around them.

However, every gaze upon their rotting face by their younger siblings screams: GO! GO AWAY ALREADY! Yet the old ones don’t see that others avoid them at the campfires, they laugh with the others when they kick away their crutches and act jovial. <br /><br />No one needs parents. All an Apocalyptic needs is siblings to whirl out into the world or live out his need for intoxication with. The old ones only sit at home or hinder the Flock’s ventures. Oh, and all their wise-ass talk. The young ones lose their patience: they hate the ugly faces. They tell them one last time that they are unwanted.

The fall is deep and deadly. <br /><br />Those who stay anyway and can win through this negative attitude must be cunning and dangerous. Such elders have made use of their years and now are lords over life and death, they are quick with the blade and are subtle schemers.

They own the hottest bordellos, their champions are amongst the best pit fighters. Their Storks buy the children of poor Scrappers or farmers at dawn, teach them to pick pockets and to perform evasive maneuvers. Smuggling, slavery, assassinations – the Carrion Birds are in. They have always been led by a Raven, or more accurately: the Mother of Ravens. Since the era of the beast, a person of that name was the talk of the town. With her claws, she tore enemies’ throats out, full of anger. She was there when Exalt fell, took part in the City Wars and in Cultrin’s march. Generations of lovers became caught in her web and died after making love to her. She birthed whole tribes in the East: Ravens in the Balkhan, in Pollen, and in Borca have her blood in their veins. The incapable ones amongst her children she killed in their sleep, cooking and eating them so they returned to her womb – food for the next spawn already making her belly swell. But that was centuries ago. The Mother of Ravens nesting amidst her Flock like a haggard demon nowadays simply has to be someone else.

Hard work is for those dumb Anabaptists who sacrifice today for tomorrow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Apocalyptics’ reputation in the towns is thus divided. For Scrappers, the temples of lust and the inns are the only places to call home during their stay in the civilization. For a fair price, the migrants soften up a hard life with distillate, Burn, and love for sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Jehammedans usually are somewhat stricter. The migrants seduce people and thus drive a thorn into the Cult’s side that festers and leads to gangrene. Many a family was cast out and had its Icons smashed because their venerable Abramis or Saraelis succumbed to a Magpie’s charms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Anabaptists can deal with passion and excess as long as they come from a pure soul, but the Apocalyptics carry decay in their lungs and Burn buds in their pockets.

That cannot be tolerated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The East Wind Flock got to feel the anger of the Cults.

Finally, the Spitalians sussed out the East Wind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Led by Dr. Heilkamp and the Office of Hygienics, they compiled dossiers on all Flock members. Heilkamp always knew where the Ravens were and what was stored in their warehouses. Then, the Great Purge followed. In a concerted action of Judges, Anabaptists, and Spitalians, all Flock members were herded together and killed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The other Flocks got the message.

For decades, the Neolibyans have been fighting pirates who come rushing in nimble torpedo boats, board the African transport ships, get everything valuable off board, and disappear again within 30 minutes. Other pirates are less interested in the cargo: they block the ships with wire or attach explosives to the hull. Here’s one in the eye for attacking a pirates’ nest, with kindest regards. Others throw garments infected with the pox or the plague at the crew – and then sell them the remedy. Or at least something that looks like a remedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Among those pirates are some who have changed sides: Africans who wanted to get away from the Neolibyans’ and Scourgers’ paternalism. In the Flocks, they have the same rights as everyone else, they repay every humiliation with fist and cutlass. They are said to attack their enemies like hungry hyenas when boarding a ship, tearing them apart mercilessly. Of course, the African Apocalyptics know what would happen if they ever were caught by Scourgers: they would skin the traitors or nail them to the ship’s side. That’s motivation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">After a capturing mission, the sea birds return to Europe’s Mediterranean coast. They enter estuaries, pass underwater chain barriers, and navigate to their hideouts where they unload and celebrate their success. Supposedly, some Albatrosses have dared to do the impossible: in the bellies of cannibalized boats, they built small ports and dry-docks on Bedain’s coast – right under the Neolibyans’ noses! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The steel island of Corpse is another legend. Close to the Reaper’s Blow, it remains hidden behind yellow-brown billows for weeks. Only when the wind turns does its iron wall gleam in the sunlight. For centuries, pirates have been capturing ships and sailing them to Corpse. Today, a wall of hulls lashed and partially welded together forms a barrier around the island that no Scourger squad can penetrate. If you’re looking for a ship of extraordinary quality, you should get on board. But the boat blocking the opening in the rusty wall doesn’t move for just any Albatross. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Those who want to enter need to have made a name for themselves – and be armed well enough to step into the known world’s most depraved location.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>LION'S BLOOD</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Tripol, there is a market for gambling, prostitution, and services beyond the Bank of Commerce’s tenders.

Fuel is expensive, and the roaring engines call forth from their holes all of the surrounding area’s scum.

Should they have learned from them?</p>\n<p>Chroniclers are known for dealing with fun and sexuality like Spitalians do with Psychonauts. Beyond normal life, this gives them a lot of time to sniff around in other people’s affairs. The Cluster has evaluated hundreds of thousands of Stream extracts related to the Apocalyptics over the centuries and added findings of Streamers and Mediators to them. What’s interesting is that they found an inherent structure in this trove of data. Information clustered around blank spots, joining to form a giant puzzle that had to be expanded several times and finally was transferred into an n-dimensional data space. Click! Every day, new data comes in, sticking to the structures or strengthening existing links. The silhouettes of the black spots are higher in contrast than ever before, mocking the Chroniclers and keeping them going until, yes, until … Yes!</p>\n<p>In the beginning, there was Gerome Getrell.</p>\n<p>He was a billionaire, visionary, brilliant orator, and televangelist. He preached the power of the archetypes and of the Tarot, free love and sadism, nationalism and anarchy, democracy and dictatorship, a life on the fast lane, subversion. His Streamcasts made the data paths glow, illuminating the deepest recesses of the Bygone soul. One feed alone generated thousands of interpretations, most of which were founded on Getrell’s paradoxes. Everyone felt he was onto something, a feeling of insight. Getrell’s wisdom promised freedom in an overregulated world to those who were able to decipher the feeds and see the truth between the contradictions.</p>\n<p>Passion over mind was the simplest interpretation.</p>\n<p>Their proponents set forth to shock. They formed gangs that at first were only known for ecstatic parties and orgies, drug abuse, mass brawls, and storming public buildings – a nuisance, but not a danger that couldn’t be handled with truncheons and shockers.</p>\n<p>But the gangs grew, and so did their confidence and ruthlessness. With a fleet of captured drones, they cut a bloody swath through the ranks of established cartels to finally take over the drug market. They discovered prototype mobile factories and produced guns and metal blades for the masses in them. They avoided the security forces, but they didn’t hide. They were free as a bird, and when one of them was shot down, the Flock didn’t care. Wherever they appeared, they sprayed a stylized raven on the wall, the sign of Getrell’s Apocalyptics.</p>\n<p>Getrell never took a stance on this. He never referred to current events. He was above the fray.</p>\n<p>The tree of chaos he had planted continued to produce colorful blossoms, some of them poisonous, some of them wholesome. For there were peaceful offshoots as well: spiritual people who turned their backs on the established religions in disappointment and found inner strength in Getrell’s mystical Tarot.</p>\n<p>He disappeared a few months before the Eshaton. His Stream feeds kept hammering into his disciples’ skulls, but there were no updates. He didn’t tell them what the future held. Journalists looking for him got lost in the thicket of his corporations. He had to be somewhere in there.</p>\n<p>Here, the Chroniclers lose his track.</p>\n<p>His followers stepped up, dominating the Stream almost until it collapsed. At that time, the Apocalyptics were an outlet for many people. Really live just one last time, feel every nuance of your own suffering and joy…</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>FALSE PROPHET</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Streamfeed-Subject: Manipulation</p>\n<p>From: Ammit@hiddenhost</p>\n<p>To: *</p>\n<p>Gerome Getrell did not address you, your wife, your kids, or your neighbors.

They quickly conquered the black markets, placing intermediaries with the UEO soldiers monitoring the reconstruction. Through them, the Apocalyptics got their hands on food, weapons, and filtration systems and stashed them in the ruins. Those who got in the way were bribed, blackmailed, or killed.

Their Storks buy the children of poor Scrappers or farmers at dawn, teach them to pick pockets and to perform evasive maneuvers. Smuggling, slavery, assassinations – the Carrion Birds are in.

With her claws, she tore enemies’ throats out, full of anger. She was there when Exalt fell, took part in the City Wars and in Cultrin’s march. Generations of lovers became caught in her web and died after making love to her. She birthed whole tribes in the East: Ravens in the Balkhan, in Pollen, and in Borca have her blood in their veins. The incapable ones amongst her children she killed in their sleep, cooking and eating them so they returned to her womb – food for the next spawn already making her belly swell.

For Scrappers, the temples of lust and the inns are the only places to call home during their stay in the civilization. For a fair price, the migrants soften up a hard life with distillate, Burn, and love for sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Jehammedans usually are somewhat stricter.

For decades, the Neolibyans have been fighting pirates who come rushing in nimble torpedo boats, board the African transport ships, get everything valuable off board, and disappear again within 30 minutes. Other pirates are less interested in the cargo: they block the ships with wire or attach explosives to the hull. Here’s one in the eye for attacking a pirates’ nest, with kindest regards. Others throw garments infected with the pox or the plague at the crew – and then sell them the remedy. Or at least something that looks like a remedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Among those pirates are some who have changed sides: Africans who wanted to get away from the Neolibyans’ and Scourgers’ paternalism. In the Flocks, they have the same rights as everyone else, they repay every humiliation with fist and cutlass. They are said to attack their enemies like hungry hyenas when boarding a ship, tearing them apart mercilessly. Of course, the African Apocalyptics know what would happen if they ever were caught by Scourgers: they would skin the traitors or nail them to the ship’s side. That’s motivation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">After a capturing mission, the sea birds return to Europe’s Mediterranean coast. They enter estuaries, pass underwater chain barriers, and navigate to their hideouts where they unload and celebrate their success. Supposedly, some Albatrosses have dared to do the impossible: in the bellies of cannibalized boats, they built small ports and dry-docks on Bedain’s coast – right under the Neolibyans’ noses! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The steel island of Corpse is another legend. Close to the Reaper’s Blow, it remains hidden behind yellow-brown billows for weeks. Only when the wind turns does its iron wall gleam in the sunlight. For centuries, pirates have been capturing ships and sailing them to Corpse. Today, a wall of hulls lashed and partially welded together forms a barrier around the island that no Scourger squad can penetrate. If you’re looking for a ship of extraordinary quality, you should get on board. But the boat blocking the opening in the rusty wall doesn’t move for just any Albatross. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Those who want to enter need to have made a name for themselves – and be armed well enough to step into the known world’s most depraved location.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>LION'S BLOOD</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Tripol, there is a market for gambling, prostitution, and services beyond the Bank of Commerce’s tenders.

The frames of the glasses are now pressed tightly around the eyes, tubes are pushed into the mouth. A microphone membrane transmits the sound of every breath, every wheezing of the lungs and the squelching of the saliva-covered tubes to an amp hanging in front of the chest by a two finger-thick cables. The sounds are distorted and produce grotesque feedback as they mingle with the static noise and the mumbling of hundreds of speakers in the background.

difficult to trace their own origins via family trees or records back into the past through the decades. The records from pre-Eshaton times are forever lost, replaced by myths and legends of golden cities and flying humans. The past means nothing, today is everything. The Chroniclers see things differently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Before the Eshaton, they called themselves Streamers. They were more a movement of like-minded people than an organized group. The continuous flow of data linking everything, the Stream, was at the center of their interests and often their lives. The humans were the neurons in its global network, and it transmitted the impulses. Entire cultures and humanity’s knowledge had merged into the Stream and continued existing within it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Eshaton interrupted the flow of data, tore apart social structures paralleling the web of data. Centuries-old knowledge was lost. The last residues in the minds of the surviving generation were beaten out of their intelligent heads in the era of the beast. The counter had thus been reset to zero. Later on, the Chroniclers started calling the enormous catastrophe in 2073 the Zero Event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As the world around them rushed toward a new Stone Age and turned to archaic ways of civilization, the Streamers kept alive what little ancient knowledge they were able to salvage. Across all of Borca, they collected user manuals, storage devices, circuit boards, and server stacks. In the first decades, the Streamers were only technophile looters, filling basements with scrap without too much expertise. They were not yet organized, but their desire for the rebirth of the Stream seemed to propel them all down the same path. Still, they lacked a core of crystallization – a charismatic leader, a great technician or Messiah giving their deeds purpose and conjuring up a future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The year 2102 is considered the year of the founding of the Cult. In the next spring, they built a Central Cluster in a freight yard and electrified the installation’s digital heart. A Static Stream was back online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">But all Streamcasts that might shed some light on these circumstances are hidden behind cascades of passwords. No one knows the reason. Presumably, the last authorized Chronicler died centuries ago. Since then, the Chroniclers have been digging into the data, circumventing security mechanisms, overcoming barriers and installing backdoors. Using newly entered Stream data, they construct bridges across digital deathtraps and skirt defense complexes. But what hides within its core?</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>START</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵<br />@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.timeline.6j15f1Nl0YjS6WgD.JournalEntryPage.52D2v5VC674lIBPR#2109-━-cathedral-city]{2109}</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">It didn’t take long for a wild bunch of Streamers to form a community that knew only one goal: fully reactivate the Stream. Once the digital heart was beating again and old knowledge began to burst from it, the Golden Age would be near. The Streamers wanted nothing less than to revert to the time before the Eshaton. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Securing the Cologne cathedral and an adjoining museum with a computer center was the first coordinated step forward. On the surface, they found a bubble of Static Stream, extracted it, dissected it, and sank into its core. For years, they mined data, layer by layer. They made a technological leap from the status of a Stone Age cult with residual information to a high-tech organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The research was far from complete when Anabaptists stormed the cathedral in 2148. The Chroniclers were no match for these fanatics.

Shards of mirrored glass were added to their robes. A modulator amp distorts their voices. The Cultists now look and sound like irate gods. But that wasn’t enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If they had learned one thing from the Stream, it was the fact that information was power. So they made themselves indispensable. A new currency replaced simple trade, issuing so-called Chronicler Drafts in exchange for artifacts. The consigned counter value of these were pure, condensed information from the think tanks of the Cult. Crumbled sheets of paper with their barcodes and columns of numbers could be simply exchanged for directions to preserved, pre-Eshaton storages, spy data, compromising information on enemies, or scientific texts on flora and fauna at the next Cluster. Everything the Chroniclers heard was entered into the always hungry data storages and distilled for redistribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Cities could no longer avoid the Cult’s influence. Refusing a Chronicler a seat on the Council would inevitably lead to all of the Cultists leaving the city. Not to mention sudden “special” discounts on information regarding their unsuspecting leaders. Soon the Chroniclers needed no mercenaries to secure their interests. The Chroniclers had become an economical factor to the ruling class, and indispensable for a vast network of Scrappers and traders. The well-being of the Chroniclers became crucial to the prosperity of them all.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>OPERATING SYSTEM</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">REFERENCE⏵</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Chroniclers’ language is strange and eerily monosyllabic to foreigners.

In the wasteland, strength and endurance are crucial. Children with a great deal of imagination and interests in Bygone writings are usually not good at working the land and thus cost more than they earn.

While the Chroniclers consider it ultimate and unique in its nerve-rending beauty, with its technological proliferation and the constant noise of a thousand distorted speakers, another Cluster arose in Frankan Aquitaine. It is in no way inferior to its Borcan inspiration, neither with regards to its bizarre setup nor its regional influence. In fact, Aquitaine has been steadily rising within the internal ranking over the last few years. East of the rural areas, the steel cadavers of planes and ship hulls were joined into a labyrinthine jungle of ancient technology by chain bridges and catwalks. Ships shot to pieces and broken parts of oil rigs hang in the silt like insects in a web, and every day, new flotsam crashes against their steel hulls. More and more Chroniclers go here seeking the special artifacts that wash ashore. Scrappers climb from ship to ship, cutting them apart with arc welders or exploring their cargo holds. With nets, they recover crates from the water. The granulate they toss back into the sea, but the machinery – wrapped in oilcloth and perfectly preserved – they drag to the Chroniclers. They have found quite a lot already! Black steel tubes clinging to one another like lugworms, dull white cubes that even a knife cannot scratch, spindles of light metal wrapped in bands of glowing stones full of cables and boards. The Chroniclers dig into these artifacts like predators, ecstatically dissecting everything they can get their hands on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Yet they have no idea what it all is. Why have these ships been torn apart? Were humans on board at one point? Perhaps there is some connection to the strange symbols on these ships? No one in Europe has ever seen their linear and circular drawings. Are they letters? No one can even understand or place them. The Scrappers are asked the same question every time they return from their raids with new artifacts. “Corpses?” They shake their heads, snorting or spitting. Forced to give the same response every time, much to their chagrin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Chroniclers have learned to take that as a “no”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Clusters in Justitian and Aquitaine are the largest ones, but not the only ones. Smaller Clusters can be found in almost any larger Borcan and Frankan city. The Needle Tower Disaster stopped them from spreading across the Reaper’s Blow into East Borca and beyond early on. Though the Spitalians had paid their respects to the Cult’s Fragments and invited them to establish a base in Danzig, Pollen, they had only turned up their Vocoders and answered “Zero!” In the far west, it is the same story.

What about the sanctioned weapons, weren’t they registered in the system only days ago?</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>RESISTANCE EQUALS TENSION DIVIDED BY STRENGTH</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">REFERENCE⏵</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Patterns that remained the same for decades suddenly change. The Cockroach Clan has grown stronger. The Enemoi Clan has accessed sealed Streams and sub nodes waiting for their final extraction by a Fragment in at least two places in the wasteland. The Scrappers’ movements have become less fractured and more chaotic, avoiding areas claimed by Clans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Clans are rising, occupying whole blocks, ambushing Judges and killing them. But these blocks had not been fully combed through yet! The Chroniclers are confused. Their answer is the Paradigmas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Highly specialized and equipped with advanced technology, they glide into the wasteland amidst a corona of electrical discharges. When they raise their voices, sonic waves paint patterns in the dust. The dirt on windowsills one hundred steps away dances. They are like gods, and they vanquish those who are weak of will and ready to believe. The Clans are their material. Embedded into the system, they become tools. At the same time, flickering walls of images awaken all over Borca. Single panels are missing and clusters of pixels are dead, but the shapes of Chroniclers passing in an endless march are recognizable. The images are jerky and distorted by static noise. For a brief second, full frontal views of masked faces fill the image walls. Then the endless march takes over again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">If someone steps in front of an image wall, a masked face appears, larger than life, its eyeglasses glaring suns. The image pulses. Assignments sent by the Cluster rattle through the speakers. The Paradigmas are impressive, and the image walls attract Clanners from all over the area. The Chroniclers’ presence grows. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Solitary Chroniclers on field missions also know how to gain respect. With one pinky of their Streamer gloves, they can dispense electrical shocks. This is where the widely known gesture comes from. If you show someone your pinky, you’re sending them a warning. They better stay clear of you. The effect is even more impressive when a Chronicler uses the gesture. Especially when the barely enlightened and superstitious population of the wasteland considers the shocks an innate ability of the Chroniclers.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":75000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>Fragment Modus on unknown mission in Cathedral City, potential access to data core.

difficult to trace their own origins via family trees or records back into the past through the decades. The records from pre-Eshaton times are forever lost, replaced by myths and legends of golden cities and flying humans. The past means nothing, today is everything. The Chroniclers see things differently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Before the Eshaton, they called themselves Streamers. They were more a movement of like-minded people than an organized group. The continuous flow of data linking everything, the Stream, was at the center of their interests and often their lives. The humans were the neurons in its global network, and it transmitted the impulses. Entire cultures and humanity’s knowledge had merged into the Stream and continued existing within it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Eshaton interrupted the flow of data, tore apart social structures paralleling the web of data. Centuries-old knowledge was lost. The last residues in the minds of the surviving generation were beaten out of their intelligent heads in the era of the beast. The counter had thus been reset to zero. Later on, the Chroniclers started calling the enormous catastrophe in 2073 the Zero Event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As the world around them rushed toward a new Stone Age and turned to archaic ways of civilization, the Streamers kept alive what little ancient knowledge they were able to salvage. Across all of Borca, they collected user manuals, storage devices, circuit boards, and server stacks. In the first decades, the Streamers were only technophile looters, filling basements with scrap without too much expertise. They were not yet organized, but their desire for the rebirth of the Stream seemed to propel them all down the same path. Still, they lacked a core of crystallization – a charismatic leader, a great technician or Messiah giving their deeds purpose and conjuring up a future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The year 2102 is considered the year of the founding of the Cult.

No one knows the reason. Presumably, the last authorized Chronicler died centuries ago. Since then, the Chroniclers have been digging into the data, circumventing security mechanisms, overcoming barriers and installing backdoors. Using newly entered Stream data, they construct bridges across digital deathtraps and skirt defense complexes.

Shards of mirrored glass were added to their robes. A modulator amp distorts their voices. The Cultists now look and sound like irate gods. But that wasn’t enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If they had learned one thing from the Stream, it was the fact that information was power. So they made themselves indispensable. A new currency replaced simple trade, issuing so-called Chronicler Drafts in exchange for artifacts. The consigned counter value of these were pure, condensed information from the think tanks of the Cult. Crumbled sheets of paper with their barcodes and columns of numbers could be simply exchanged for directions to preserved, pre-Eshaton storages, spy data, compromising information on enemies, or scientific texts on flora and fauna at the next Cluster. Everything the Chroniclers heard was entered into the always hungry data storages and distilled for redistribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Cities could no longer avoid the Cult’s influence. Refusing a Chronicler a seat on the Council would inevitably lead to all of the Cultists leaving the city. Not to mention sudden “special” discounts on information regarding their unsuspecting leaders. Soon the Chroniclers needed no mercenaries to secure their interests. The Chroniclers had become an economical factor to the ruling class, and indispensable for a vast network of Scrappers and traders.

In the wasteland, strength and endurance are crucial. Children with a great deal of imagination and interests in Bygone writings are usually not good at working the land and thus cost more than they earn.

While the Chroniclers consider it ultimate and unique in its nerve-rending beauty, with its technological proliferation and the constant noise of a thousand distorted speakers, another Cluster arose in Frankan Aquitaine. It is in no way inferior to its Borcan inspiration, neither with regards to its bizarre setup nor its regional influence. In fact, Aquitaine has been steadily rising within the internal ranking over the last few years. East of the rural areas, the steel cadavers of planes and ship hulls were joined into a labyrinthine jungle of ancient technology by chain bridges and catwalks. Ships shot to pieces and broken parts of oil rigs hang in the silt like insects in a web, and every day, new flotsam crashes against their steel hulls. More and more Chroniclers go here seeking the special artifacts that wash ashore. Scrappers climb from ship to ship, cutting them apart with arc welders or exploring their cargo holds. With nets, they recover crates from the water. The granulate they toss back into the sea, but the machinery – wrapped in oilcloth and perfectly preserved – they drag to the Chroniclers. They have found quite a lot already! Black steel tubes clinging to one another like lugworms, dull white cubes that even a knife cannot scratch, spindles of light metal wrapped in bands of glowing stones full of cables and boards. The Chroniclers dig into these artifacts like predators, ecstatically dissecting everything they can get their hands on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Yet they have no idea what it all is. Why have these ships been torn apart? Were humans on board at one point? Perhaps there is some connection to the strange symbols on these ships? No one in Europe has ever seen their linear and circular drawings. Are they letters? No one can even understand or place them. The Scrappers are asked the same question every time they return from their raids with new artifacts. “Corpses?” They shake their heads, snorting or spitting. Forced to give the same response every time, much to their chagrin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Chroniclers have learned to take that as a “no”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Clusters in Justitian and Aquitaine are the largest ones, but not the only ones. Smaller Clusters can be found in almost any larger Borcan and Frankan city. The Needle Tower Disaster stopped them from spreading across the Reaper’s Blow into East Borca and beyond early on. Though the Spitalians had paid their respects to the Cult’s Fragments and invited them to establish a base in Danzig, Pollen, they had only turned up their Vocoders and answered “Zero!” In the far west, it is the same story. The Cultists’ insubordination grows in sync with their distance to the Central Cluster, the Fragments suspect. Plus, their safety is uncertain. While Chroniclers are indispensable in Borca where their sheer presence garners respect and T H E MIRROR The Clusters hoard enormous amounts of knowledge. The Static Stream expands in fractal coils, attached data is assimilated and fills gaps. It approaches a critical mass. This knowledge attracts those who consider it their possession: since the day the Recombination Group’s Dispensers opened up for the first time, Sleepers have been infiltrating the Chroniclers. They pose as devout followers and climb within the hierarchy. But actually, they have fallen for a trap. Once they dive into the core for the first time, they swim within a world of mirrored data, operating with files and images destined for their eyes only. Meanwhile, transponders record the data flow from their nanite blood and extract pass codes. Should one of them penetrate the mirror anyway, the Cluster’s radio masts send a code that will not remain unheard. One of the ancients stirs, flexes her leathery skin and gets up on her mechanical leg. Her anger is boundless. attention, the Hybrispanians are not so dependent on the Cult’s mercy.

In its stone labyrinths, ancient computer systems work, managing the Hellvetics’ merits and Central storage. Endless knowledge and surely a piece of Static Stream must be trapped in there. The Chroniclers would love to extract it, but the descendants of the Swiss military have always denied the Cult any kind of access. No reasons given. They do not listen to reason. “Why do you do that?” scream the overloading Vocoders.

This knowledge attracts those who consider it their possession: since the day the Recombination Group’s Dispensers opened up for the first time, Sleepers have been infiltrating the Chroniclers. They pose as devout followers and climb within the hierarchy. But actually, they have fallen for a trap. Once they dive into the core for the first time, they swim within a world of mirrored data, operating with files and images destined for their eyes only. Meanwhile, transponders record the data flow from their nanite blood and extract pass codes. Should one of them penetrate the mirror anyway, the Cluster’s radio masts send a code that will not remain unheard.

No one considers an organization that is practically unarmed a danger, and no one would welcome an organization in their own capital if it were armed to the teeth. Deadly weapons, thus, have always been considered sanctioned. Chroniclers may not use them. <br /><br />Shutters have turned their backs to the Cult, though. Officially. That their score is still available is a result of data storage, which is very complicated. It’s amazing how unerringly they recognize current enemies of the Cult and eliminate them without any help.

There, they waited. Those who wanted to survive stayed with their families or joined a group: loners stood no chance. “You only have two eyes, and they are both looking to the front”, the elders said. “You need someone to watch your back.”<br /><br />The people closed ranks. They gave up their old lives and allowed their instincts to take control. They looked to the fire, used the day, and hid by night. They listened to the stories of their elders, became trappers, and learned how to use lead pipes against opponents. Primordial cries sounded through the ruins.<br /><br />The individual lost ground and became one with the Clan. Everyone had a role to play: in the first years after the Eshaton worth was dictated by ability, later, when the cultural decline began, by birth and sex. Those who wanted to make an exception endangered the Clan.<br /><br />Survival was hard enough, why bother trying to deal with deviants? Punishment was both quick and strict.<br /><br />They survived the Eshaton, HIVE, the dark decades, and the era of the beast. They had reached the lowest point of civilization, tasted the waters of Lethe, and yet had risen again.<br /><br />The Clans grew. They allowed themselves to create value systems, at first only directed toward survival and their Clan’s strength, later incorporating the weak and the old. Cultures crystallized around these ideas.

They listened to the stories of their elders, became trappers, and learned how to use lead pipes against opponents.

They allowed themselves to create value systems, at first only directed toward survival and their Clan’s strength, later incorporating the weak and the old. Cultures crystallized around these ideas.

Then, they settled close to the fields. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The wheat was highly resistant and undemanding, thriving in the cold close to the Ice Barrier just as well as in Pollen’s dry climate.

It can only be found where Judges or Hellvetics have tread paths in the dust. Beyond them, in the unexplored territories, anything is possible. For centuries, Clans whose grasp of humanity has suffered dearly through ongoing incest have been living in the shadows of civilisation. For the Spitalians, these wild Clans could make an interesting field of research, for they still retain some Bygone blood undiluted by inbreeding with a large gene pool for generations.</p>\n<p>However, these savages do not cooperate.</p>\n<p>Instead, they are very dangerous. Their Shamans, Chieftains, or Founders are hulking figures who can unite the whole incestuous Clan into one group bristling with weapons with one shout. They kill anyone who approaches them and devour the bodies. They are like animals, greedy and wild, unfettered by any cultural values. They sleep with rats, snarl at Gendos, and determine their ranks through bloody battles. They are not good neighbors. When they are hungry and leave their valleys, the good settlers bar their huts, call for the Anabaptists and grab their spears. None shall escape!</p>\n<p>The settlers’ outlook is biased by centuries of conflict. Every Clan knows its own stories of cannibals, screaming savages whose skin is painted white with dirt and who carry glass daggers. The savages broke into huts, slashed women’s faces and throats and stole children. The elders still weep when they talk about the village warriors’ retribution and how they found only bloodstained spits next to burned campfires and gnawed bones. No one begrudges them a certain distrust towards strangers.</p>\n<p>Only very few of the savages are cannibals, though. They are all marked by their distance from the large civilizations. Some have lived for centuries unmolested by Judges and Spitalians, having seen nothing but their valley’s steep slopes and their ancestors’ bunkers. They were happy with the isolation. However, others watched the large cities’ sea of lights and smoking chimneys from the hills, pressed tightly to the ground. They were afraid. The people down there were aggressive and too quick to draw their weapons. Their language was gibberish, they usually shouted strange words as they waved their pointy metal sticks and their fire-throwers in their direction. The savages retreated to convene and wait. Only great need or great injustice would turn their fear into hatred. Then not even the greatest of cities would be safe anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>POWER AND INFLUENCE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Anabaptists started out as a small group of faithful gathered around the alleged Messiah called Rebus.

At the same time, the Anabaptists’ aqueducts crisscross wide areas, speaking of Cathedral City’s dignity and benevolence. In the Alpine foothills, the Hellvetics have dug in, guarding the trade routes as they have for ages. The Clans ruled by these Cults have tolerated the paternalism for a long time. The Judges and Anabaptists chased all the scum from their territory to a place where no hails of lead and no walls of blades awaited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Before, those who fancied themselves dressed in Justitian fashion took hand-rolled medicine globules and thanked Rebus the Baptist for every healthy downpour. The people looked upon their settlements with pride, saw themselves as Ferropolites, Earfielders, Leadfielders, Liquans. The young ones pined for Justitian, dreaming of being legal citizens of this vibrant metropolis. They scratched lichens from the Judgement stones and brought a soup made of boiled roots to their local Judges on a daily basis until the fat and lazy Judges walked next to their mares because they couldn’t mount them anymore. They listened to the Judges’ breathless accounts of giant battles against the Cockroach Clan and heard them scoff about the foolish Exalters who still drank water from their poisoned wells. They even laughed at the bad jokes. They did not listen to their elders anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Now, something is stirring. The Cockroaches never disappeared. They only fled deeper into the Bygone tunnels. They lurk again in the shadows of the seas of debris, attacking as swift as lightning only to disappear back into the underground with their prey. The Exalters confront Justitian as they did before. The Chroniclers had to use their full repertoire of infamy and underhanded tactics to keep the Enemoi Clan away from ancient stores of knowledge, but suddenly the Judges are tied up in the battle against the Cockroaches and harshly sweep aside the technology-obsessed Cult’s pleas for help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Praha’s fall does the rest. The Clans and kinsmen remember their roots, find their way back to their old pride. The elders’ words are listened to once again. They have never needed Justitian, and they never will. Revenge is such an ugly word, such an uncivilized feeling. Even so, just look at those complacent blubberbutts with their dusty waistcoats and floppy hats… </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Hellvetics had not fared much better. The Clans in the cantons rose up, raged against their former compulsory allies in neighboring cities, and lost themselves in endless trade wars. Hellvetica watched this for years. Couldn’t the people have marched into a blessed future thankfully – and more importantly, together? Would that have been so difficult? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Commanders of the Territorial Region convened. They had seen enough. There was no need for discussion anymore. They called their soldiers back into the mountain, leaving the thankless bunch to reality. Reality was happy to oblige, for it had always been lurking at the fringe of perception on snow-covered peaks and passes. Like an avalanche, it hit the lowlands in the shape of the hordes of expelled valley Clans and mountain tribes. The people in the Swiss heartland had to fight for their homes for the first time, forced to arm themselves with pointed spears instead of harsh words. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The cities hate each other and have largely turned into military camps. However, they do not attack each other. While the citizens of Bern, Lyss, and Worb are united by a tradition of animosity, the enmity towards other cantons runs much deeper. However, the savages from the mountains are even worse. Maybe they all have more in common than they care to admit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Beyond the Reaper’s Blow in East Borca, the shockwaves rushing outwards from Praha’s fall can be felt much more strongly. Nomads still roam the conifer forests and follow the giant herds on their north-south route. However, large Clans are moving towards Praha from the north. Everyone wants to see the city that has been hidden from the public eye for so long, and once they are there, they might as well just grab something as a recompense for the long journey. There have been non-stop skirmishes and full-blown family feuds tearing apart the land ever since the city’s fall: Praha seems to have become much more dangerous.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> For a long time, Osman was considered untouchable. The Jehammedans stuck together and tilled the land wisely and justly. The farming Clans had no reason to complain. The unrest now comes from another direction. Over the centuries, the Osmani had an army of foreigners, the Janites, that now consists of hundreds of militarized Clans. They ride out every day to cull the savages in the area in bloody skirmishes. They die for Osman, giving their lives in the grim knowledge that by doing so, they buy a place in the Janites’ ranks for their children. However, the Iconides mistrust them. Praha has taught them a lesson.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>FRANKA</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Frankan Clans live far away from large Pheromancer strongholds like Souffrance. Many families returned home years after the Eshaton to rebuild what was rightfully theirs. Those estates in the overgrown or swamped ruins are now several centuries old. Many of the venerable buildings are still in good repair, but others look more like a cavern. The floors have collapsed under the weight of time, and ivy and grass cover the cavities. The Clanners make the best of it. They fight the humidity with campfires, cut down the brush, and live on fish and damp grasses. All of them can survive in the swamps with nothing but a spear. They use lakes and rivers to hide from swarm and Pheromancer alike. Some Frankan Clans have retreated to the rivers. They live on rafts or boats tied together and watch the Aberrants’ movements from a safe distance. They do not need to fear ant swarms or the storms of wasps. It seems that perhaps pheromone markers cannot travel through the air over running water.</p>\n<p>Few Clans stay clear from the conflict with the Pheromancers. Fewer even have this option. Those who still can fight the intruders – anointed with Marduk oil they creep into the Ziggurats and breeding chambers to destroy the Queens or blow up the methane vents. The Spital helps them by getting EX, other drugs, and detonation cartridges into the frontier settlements. Smuggler Clans transport them inland.</p>\n<p>In Briton, the situation is desperate. The Anabaptists’ and Spitalians’ supply trains are not coming in, so they lack food and personnel, while termites are busy building vent after vent.

They carry Splayers salvaged from the bodies of fallen Famulancers’ and are given bag-like gas masks from local stores, for which they are called “Grenouilles”: frogs. They see their home trembling under masses of insects, watch the vents growing on their territory. No one fights harder than they do.</p>\n<p>The gases heavy with pheromones drift to the northeast, into the Stukov. They cover the desert, sink in, and change. Under the salt crust, new life grows – the engine of evolution starts. Here, the Clans eat Dust Worms and Desert Clams, creatures the Spitalian probably wouldn’t find even in their textbooks. Their hunters are as implacable as the climate, but still they deal with the Spitalians, exchanging Flying Leeches, Stukov Scorpions, Rift Centipedes, and Husk Spiders for drugs and weapons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>POLLEN</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The constant change of the environment, the withering tundra, the ever-present gossamer, and the cold all force the Pollners into eternal wanderings. Wherever they stop, they fight the ground for food: they catch insects in pits, they scratch mosses from rocks, or they dig roots from the ground. Anything that can be cooked is edible.</p>\n<p>However, for some years now, the land has been changing. The rock underfoot trembles, snow is melting in circular formations, the ground is feverishly hot. Spore fields rot, replaced by gaudy green vegetation growing along fractal paths. Fruit hangs fully and seductively from the trees of this awakening paradise. Danger lurks, though: One tiny scratch and they burst and cover the plucking hand with a hot, grainy sap. Some Clans go looking for those Fractal Forests. They harvest the fruit and sell it to the Anabaptists’ emissaries at the Alpine passage of Ternitz.</p>\n<p>The Apocalyptics have witnessed this game long enough now. Pollen has always been the Mother of Raven’s pasture, and she cannot remember having given a concession to these Clans. Strictly speaking, she has never given a concession to anyone. But what does that matter? The migratory birds are gathering. When they come across a Clan in the Fractal Forests, they descend upon it like a murder of hungry crows. However, the Pollners have been stoically chewing lichens for centuries, have defied the cold, the Spore Beasts, and the Biokinetics, and they do not plan to run. War cries echo from the woods – the battle between primal and trained brutality has just begun.</p>\n<p>The Spitalians are somewhere in between. Their Preservists burn down the Fractal Forests wherever they can find them, decrying them as a strange Primer function. Neither the Clans nor the Apocalyptics can tolerate this.</p>\n<p>Although the Ice Barrier devours several feet of land every day, some Clans have survived up north. None of them consist of more than 30 people today, but they likely all come from a Clan shattered some 300 years ago. Indicative of that fact, they all wait for the Horse Oracle, an enigmatic three-faced figure, to arrive. They hunt and dig for old stores abandoned by their ancestors. The Westja Clan is extraordinarily good at that, and the Clan actively trades with the Spitalians in snow-laden Danzig.</p>\n<p>Resident Clans are rare in Pollen. The largest Clan is the Wroclaw confederation, led by the Piast and his Druschinniks. Dozens of Clans had to bend their knees to him in order to enter the inner ring within the city walls and profit from his Eternal Oasis. The Africans are using Wroclaw as a starting point on their hunt for Biokinetics and have stationed a Surge Tank next to the entrance as a show of good will and trust, so the city is considered unassailable. Still, Praha’s fall terrified the Wroclaw Clans. Where will the hordes go when there is no loot left?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>BALKHAN</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Balkhan’s people are strident and irritable, and the same is true for its Clans. They never liked the fact that strangers make trouble in their land. Spitalians blew up Dushani rock formations and thus brought screaming madness to whole provinces. The Jehammedans drove families away from their land and into their war against the Africans, armed only with hope and a rake. Palers milked villages until their inhabitants fled into the Voivodes’ arms, gaunt and wearing nothing but rags. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This stops now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">It began in Sofia, over two winters before the fall of Praha. A nameless man joined Voivode Wiktor’s henchmen, fighting his way to the top, and became his right-hand man. On the streets, the people bowed to him. When he reached the end of the career ladder, he asked Wiktor for a meeting. They ate together, and after the meal, the man approached his Voivode, embraced him, kissed him, and broke his neck. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">From this day on, he called himself Karakhan, the black leader. The Balkhani laughed about the boisterous name. However, they soon learned that sometimes a name carries a message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Karakhan was a sensitive tactician. Within one year he had chased the Spitalians from Sofia, smoked out the surrounding bunkers, and made even the Jehammedans swear loyalty to him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Now, Karakhan and two other Voivoide Clans rule Eastern Balkhan with an iron fist. The Cults have become supplicants who must justify their every step to the Voivodes. Those who do not obey are sold into African slavery – a fact that has curbed the conflict between Balkhani and Africans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Secluded from the eternal power struggles, there are still Clans living in the mountains: cranky, frugal people distilling their own Slivovitz, living in quarry stone houses, and welcoming every stranger as long as he shows respect. However, there is no peace here, either. Some of those Clans have been warring for centuries. One wrong word or a wrong name uttered in a merry circle, and the mood changes abruptly. Children learn young never to talk about their neighbors.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>HYBRISPANIA</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵<br />@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.timeline.6j15f1Nl0YjS6WgD.JournalEntryPage.hMQV1bV2WFihyJL6#2265-━-the-strait-of-gibraltar]{2265}</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Castilian high plateau is the heart of ancient Hybrispania. The Clans are just as old, and all insist on their counterparts knowing this. They cultivate their family trees and carefully mark the branches the African invaders hacked off – the people of conquerors bearing the counterattack with stoicism. The wind of pride blows through their castles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">However, many of the ancestral homes are empty, and even in the inhabited ones dust settles in many rooms. Again, the Iconides have incited the young ones with bluster and insinuation. “Do you know what the Scourgers do to your women? They take the children by the legs and smash them against the tree, so for them, it is over quickly. But the women…” No one can elude this without soiling the family honor. Young men and women march south at the side of the Swords of Jehammed to confront the invaders. For months, the fighters live in the jungle, setting traps, lurking, attacking, and retreating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Over the decades, their tactics barely changed – until the Warpage arose and devoured Clans and Scourger units alike. Now, there are new rules, ones that do not necessarily help the Guerreros. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">When the fighters attack the Scourger emplacements in the south, they have no room to retreat – the Warpage is at their backs, pushing them on. Only the bravest and craziest dare to go deep enough into this Pregnoctic phenomenon to shake off pursuers. The Jehammedans do not care. Those with faith in their hearts will find a way. They keep whipping up the Clans and driving them south. Should they give up their motherland that easily? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Some say yes. They live in the Warpage, unknown to Scourgers and Jehammedans alike. On the high plateau they have been erased from the chronicles, considered lost. It is almost true. They fled before they were ground between the Cults, mothers and fathers who did not want to sacrifice their children on the altar of war. They have explored their part of the Warpage, know places where reality flickers granulously and tastes of mint. Sometimes they help lost people, Africans and Hybrispanians alike, by marking their path back to the war with rocks. They never show themselves.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>PURGARE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵<br />@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.timeline.6j15f1Nl0YjS6WgD.JournalEntryPage.OwNfUSBFi6ZpO0Un#2210-━-war-in-the-adriatic-lowlands]{2210}</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Filaments eat into the land and shatter space and gravitation. Creatures with needle maws beset by ticks and lice scuttle through the force fields. Suddenly, they open their blind eyes wide. War cries and the sound of horns greet them. People with swords and Spitfires come racing towards them, their eyes hot with Elysian fire. The final battle has begun, and Purgare is the battlefield. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This is not about emanations or faith anymore: The Psychokinetics are no abstract threat to tell stories about around the campfire, everyone laughing heartily afterwards. No. The Aberrants breed behind the Apennines’ mountain ranges. Night would have long since conquered Purgare if the Anabaptists did not give their lives on a daily basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Family after family has joined the Anabaptists, and the largest ones have divided Purgare amongst themselves. They aid the Orgiastics with scouts or give the basic means of life to their hordes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Even if most of the Purgan families firmly back the Anabaptists, they have conserved their internal strife and struggles. They believe in honor and land. One disrespectful word could lead to a fight that starts a circle of revenge and counter-revenge. The heads of the families may stop these feuds via decree – as long as they can keep face doing so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">However, there are deviants, too. Those who do not cooperate with the Anabaptists are pushed to the fringes of society – and off the inhabited areas. The few independents retreat to the Apennines or take a chance in Western Purgare’s sulfuric deserts. They keep their distance from the Nox Crater, but they do not fear single Psychokinetics. Every family member knows what to do when encountering one: the younger children act as bait, the older ones determine the size of the force fields and Filaments with sticks, some light fires to chase away the swarms of fleas, while others hack their way to the epicenter and kill the Psychokinetic. Anabaptists unwilling to return to their camp without a prize are more than willing to buy the Aberrants’ heads.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AFRICA</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The African Clans look back on a rich tradition.

Day by day, the tribes lose their young adults to melting pots like Tripol. The Psychovores get the rest. The elders resist. They involve the young people more strongly, let them lead the hunt, give them whites to beat, or concubines to enjoy. Old rules are re-interpreted and defended against the coca-intoxicated elders.</p>\n<p>However, even one dead sparrow hawk on the village square can be considered a bad omen and thus destroy any progress, lead a Clan back to its old ways, and ossify in tradition. However, the loss of the young is not the only danger. The Psychovores spread and steal habitats from humans. Scouts report that the Psychovores make room for humans even deep in the jungle. Giant circular areas rot within hours – but who can tell if this vesicular decay is not merely part of the circle of life? Who knows what the next cycle may bring?</p>\n<p>Some Clans have the courage to settle amidst the strange vegetation. They move on when the circle is closed.</p>\n<p>Some keep going further south.

Others gather around legendary Bygone buildings or become powerful by occupying some old warehouse. Some unite and found villages. Smiths, potters and weavers settle down. Dynasties arise.

It can only be found where Judges or Hellvetics have tread paths in the dust. Beyond them, in the unexplored territories, anything is possible. For centuries, Clans whose grasp of humanity has suffered dearly through ongoing incest have been living in the shadows of civilisation. For the Spitalians, these wild Clans could make an interesting field of research, for they still retain some Bygone blood undiluted by inbreeding with a large gene pool for generations.</p>\n<p>However, these savages do not cooperate.</p>\n<p>Instead, they are very dangerous. Their Shamans, Chieftains, or Founders are hulking figures who can unite the whole incestuous Clan into one group bristling with weapons with one shout. They kill anyone who approaches them and devour the bodies. They are like animals, greedy and wild, unfettered by any cultural values. They sleep with rats, snarl at Gendos, and determine their ranks through bloody battles. They are not good neighbors. When they are hungry and leave their valleys, the good settlers bar their huts, call for the Anabaptists and grab their spears. None shall escape!</p>\n<p>The settlers’ outlook is biased by centuries of conflict. Every Clan knows its own stories of cannibals, screaming savages whose skin is painted white with dirt and who carry glass daggers. The savages broke into huts, slashed women’s faces and throats and stole children. The elders still weep when they talk about the village warriors’ retribution and how they found only bloodstained spits next to burned campfires and gnawed bones. No one begrudges them a certain distrust towards strangers.</p>\n<p>Only very few of the savages are cannibals, though. They are all marked by their distance from the large civilizations. Some have lived for centuries unmolested by Judges and Spitalians, having seen nothing but their valley’s steep slopes and their ancestors’ bunkers. They were happy with the isolation. However, others watched the large cities’ sea of lights and smoking chimneys from the hills, pressed tightly to the ground. They were afraid. The people down there were aggressive and too quick to draw their weapons. Their language was gibberish, they usually shouted strange words as they waved their pointy metal sticks and their fire-throwers in their direction. The savages retreated to convene and wait. Only great need or great injustice would turn their fear into hatred. Then not even the greatest of cities would be safe anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>POWER AND INFLUENCE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Anabaptists started out as a small group of faithful gathered around the alleged Messiah called Rebus.

At the same time, the Anabaptists’ aqueducts crisscross wide areas, speaking of Cathedral City’s dignity and benevolence. In the Alpine foothills, the Hellvetics have dug in, guarding the trade routes as they have for ages. The Clans ruled by these Cults have tolerated the paternalism for a long time. The Judges and Anabaptists chased all the scum from their territory to a place where no hails of lead and no walls of blades awaited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Before, those who fancied themselves dressed in Justitian fashion took hand-rolled medicine globules and thanked Rebus the Baptist for every healthy downpour. The people looked upon their settlements with pride, saw themselves as Ferropolites, Earfielders, Leadfielders, Liquans. The young ones pined for Justitian, dreaming of being legal citizens of this vibrant metropolis. They scratched lichens from the Judgement stones and brought a soup made of boiled roots to their local Judges on a daily basis until the fat and lazy Judges walked next to their mares because they couldn’t mount them anymore. They listened to the Judges’ breathless accounts of giant battles against the Cockroach Clan and heard them scoff about the foolish Exalters who still drank water from their poisoned wells. They even laughed at the bad jokes. They did not listen to their elders anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Now, something is stirring. The Cockroaches never disappeared. They only fled deeper into the Bygone tunnels. They lurk again in the shadows of the seas of debris, attacking as swift as lightning only to disappear back into the underground with their prey. The Exalters confront Justitian as they did before. The Chroniclers had to use their full repertoire of infamy and underhanded tactics to keep the Enemoi Clan away from ancient stores of knowledge, but suddenly the Judges are tied up in the battle against the Cockroaches and harshly sweep aside the technology-obsessed Cult’s pleas for help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Praha’s fall does the rest. The Clans and kinsmen remember their roots, find their way back to their old pride. The elders’ words are listened to once again. They have never needed Justitian, and they never will. Revenge is such an ugly word, such an uncivilized feeling. Even so, just look at those complacent blubberbutts with their dusty waistcoats and floppy hats… </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Hellvetics had not fared much better. The Clans in the cantons rose up, raged against their former compulsory allies in neighboring cities, and lost themselves in endless trade wars. Hellvetica watched this for years. Couldn’t the people have marched into a blessed future thankfully – and more importantly, together? Would that have been so difficult? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Commanders of the Territorial Region convened. They had seen enough. There was no need for discussion anymore. They called their soldiers back into the mountain, leaving the thankless bunch to reality. Reality was happy to oblige, for it had always been lurking at the fringe of perception on snow-covered peaks and passes. Like an avalanche, it hit the lowlands in the shape of the hordes of expelled valley Clans and mountain tribes. The people in the Swiss heartland had to fight for their homes for the first time, forced to arm themselves with pointed spears instead of harsh words. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The cities hate each other and have largely turned into military camps. However, they do not attack each other. While the citizens of Bern, Lyss, and Worb are united by a tradition of animosity, the enmity towards other cantons runs much deeper. However, the savages from the mountains are even worse. Maybe they all have more in common than they care to admit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Beyond the Reaper’s Blow in East Borca, the shockwaves rushing outwards from Praha’s fall can be felt much more strongly. Nomads still roam the conifer forests and follow the giant herds on their north-south route. However, large Clans are moving towards Praha from the north. Everyone wants to see the city that has been hidden from the public eye for so long, and once they are there, they might as well just grab something as a recompense for the long journey. There have been non-stop skirmishes and full-blown family feuds tearing apart the land ever since the city’s fall: Praha seems to have become much more dangerous.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> For a long time, Osman was considered untouchable. The Jehammedans stuck together and tilled the land wisely and justly. The farming Clans had no reason to complain. The unrest now comes from another direction. Over the centuries, the Osmani had an army of foreigners, the Janites, that now consists of hundreds of militarized Clans. They ride out every day to cull the savages in the area in bloody skirmishes. They die for Osman, giving their lives in the grim knowledge that by doing so, they buy a place in the Janites’ ranks for their children. However, the Iconides mistrust them. Praha has taught them a lesson.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>FRANKA</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Frankan Clans live far away from large Pheromancer strongholds like Souffrance. Many families returned home years after the Eshaton to rebuild what was rightfully theirs. Those estates in the overgrown or swamped ruins are now several centuries old. Many of the venerable buildings are still in good repair, but others look more like a cavern. The floors have collapsed under the weight of time, and ivy and grass cover the cavities. The Clanners make the best of it. They fight the humidity with campfires, cut down the brush, and live on fish and damp grasses. All of them can survive in the swamps with nothing but a spear. They use lakes and rivers to hide from swarm and Pheromancer alike. Some Frankan Clans have retreated to the rivers. They live on rafts or boats tied together and watch the Aberrants’ movements from a safe distance. They do not need to fear ant swarms or the storms of wasps. It seems that perhaps pheromone markers cannot travel through the air over running water.</p>\n<p>Few Clans stay clear from the conflict with the Pheromancers. Fewer even have this option. Those who still can fight the intruders – anointed with Marduk oil they creep into the Ziggurats and breeding chambers to destroy the Queens or blow up the methane vents. The Spital helps them by getting EX, other drugs, and detonation cartridges into the frontier settlements. Smuggler Clans transport them inland.</p>\n<p>In Briton, the situation is desperate. The Anabaptists’ and Spitalians’ supply trains are not coming in, so they lack food and personnel, while termites are busy building vent after vent. The doctors have been training Clans who have lost their homes to the Pheromancers as deputy Spitalians. They carry Splayers salvaged from the bodies of fallen Famulancers’ and are given bag-like gas masks from local stores, for which they are called “Grenouilles”: frogs. They see their home trembling under masses of insects, watch the vents growing on their territory. No one fights harder than they do.</p>\n<p>The gases heavy with pheromones drift to the northeast, into the Stukov. They cover the desert, sink in, and change. Under the salt crust, new life grows – the engine of evolution starts. Here, the Clans eat Dust Worms and Desert Clams, creatures the Spitalian probably wouldn’t find even in their textbooks. Their hunters are as implacable as the climate, but still they deal with the Spitalians, exchanging Flying Leeches, Stukov Scorpions, Rift Centipedes, and Husk Spiders for drugs and weapons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>POLLEN</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The constant change of the environment, the withering tundra, the ever-present gossamer, and the cold all force the Pollners into eternal wanderings. Wherever they stop, they fight the ground for food: they catch insects in pits, they scratch mosses from rocks, or they dig roots from the ground. Anything that can be cooked is edible.</p>\n<p>However, for some years now, the land has been changing. The rock underfoot trembles, snow is melting in circular formations, the ground is feverishly hot. Spore fields rot, replaced by gaudy green vegetation growing along fractal paths. Fruit hangs fully and seductively from the trees of this awakening paradise. Danger lurks, though: One tiny scratch and they burst and cover the plucking hand with a hot, grainy sap. Some Clans go looking for those Fractal Forests. They harvest the fruit and sell it to the Anabaptists’ emissaries at the Alpine passage of Ternitz.</p>\n<p>The Apocalyptics have witnessed this game long enough now. Pollen has always been the Mother of Raven’s pasture, and she cannot remember having given a concession to these Clans. Strictly speaking, she has never given a concession to anyone. But what does that matter? The migratory birds are gathering. When they come across a Clan in the Fractal Forests, they descend upon it like a murder of hungry crows. However, the Pollners have been stoically chewing lichens for centuries, have defied the cold, the Spore Beasts, and the Biokinetics, and they do not plan to run. War cries echo from the woods – the battle between primal and trained brutality has just begun.</p>\n<p>The Spitalians are somewhere in between. Their Preservists burn down the Fractal Forests wherever they can find them, decrying them as a strange Primer function. Neither the Clans nor the Apocalyptics can tolerate this.</p>\n<p>Although the Ice Barrier devours several feet of land every day, some Clans have survived up north. None of them consist of more than 30 people today, but they likely all come from a Clan shattered some 300 years ago. Indicative of that fact, they all wait for the Horse Oracle, an enigmatic three-faced figure, to arrive. They hunt and dig for old stores abandoned by their ancestors. The Westja Clan is extraordinarily good at that, and the Clan actively trades with the Spitalians in snow-laden Danzig.</p>\n<p>Resident Clans are rare in Pollen. The largest Clan is the Wroclaw confederation, led by the Piast and his Druschinniks. Dozens of Clans had to bend their knees to him in order to enter the inner ring within the city walls and profit from his Eternal Oasis. The Africans are using Wroclaw as a starting point on their hunt for Biokinetics and have stationed a Surge Tank next to the entrance as a show of good will and trust, so the city is considered unassailable. Still, Praha’s fall terrified the Wroclaw Clans.

They never liked the fact that strangers make trouble in their land. Spitalians blew up Dushani rock formations and thus brought screaming madness to whole provinces. The Jehammedans drove families away from their land and into their war against the Africans, armed only with hope and a rake. Palers milked villages until their inhabitants fled into the Voivodes’ arms, gaunt and wearing nothing but rags. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This stops now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">It began in Sofia, over two winters before the fall of Praha. A nameless man joined Voivode Wiktor’s henchmen, fighting his way to the top, and became his right-hand man. On the streets, the people bowed to him. When he reached the end of the career ladder, he asked Wiktor for a meeting. They ate together, and after the meal, the man approached his Voivode, embraced him, kissed him, and broke his neck. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">From this day on, he called himself Karakhan, the black leader. The Balkhani laughed about the boisterous name. However, they soon learned that sometimes a name carries a message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Karakhan was a sensitive tactician. Within one year he had chased the Spitalians from Sofia, smoked out the surrounding bunkers, and made even the Jehammedans swear loyalty to him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Now, Karakhan and two other Voivoide Clans rule Eastern Balkhan with an iron fist. The Cults have become supplicants who must justify their every step to the Voivodes. Those who do not obey are sold into African slavery – a fact that has curbed the conflict between Balkhani and Africans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Secluded from the eternal power struggles, there are still Clans living in the mountains: cranky, frugal people distilling their own Slivovitz, living in quarry stone houses, and welcoming every stranger as long as he shows respect. However, there is no peace here, either. Some of those Clans have been warring for centuries. One wrong word or a wrong name uttered in a merry circle, and the mood changes abruptly.

The wind of pride blows through their castles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">However, many of the ancestral homes are empty, and even in the inhabited ones dust settles in many rooms. Again, the Iconides have incited the young ones with bluster and insinuation. “Do you know what the Scourgers do to your women? They take the children by the legs and smash them against the tree, so for them, it is over quickly. But the women…” No one can elude this without soiling the family honor. Young men and women march south at the side of the Swords of Jehammed to confront the invaders. For months, the fighters live in the jungle, setting traps, lurking, attacking, and retreating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Over the decades, their tactics barely changed – until the Warpage arose and devoured Clans and Scourger units alike.

Only the bravest and craziest dare to go deep enough into this Pregnoctic phenomenon to shake off pursuers. The Jehammedans do not care. Those with faith in their hearts will find a way. They keep whipping up the Clans and driving them south. Should they give up their motherland that easily? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Some say yes. They live in the Warpage, unknown to Scourgers and Jehammedans alike. On the high plateau they have been erased from the chronicles, considered lost. It is almost true. They fled before they were ground between the Cults, mothers and fathers who did not want to sacrifice their children on the altar of war. They have explored their part of the Warpage, know places where reality flickers granulously and tastes of mint. Sometimes they help lost people, Africans and Hybrispanians alike, by marking their path back to the war with rocks.

The final battle has begun, and Purgare is the battlefield. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This is not about emanations or faith anymore: The Psychokinetics are no abstract threat to tell stories about around the campfire, everyone laughing heartily afterwards.

The few independents retreat to the Apennines or take a chance in Western Purgare’s sulfuric deserts. They keep their distance from the Nox Crater, but they do not fear single Psychokinetics. Every family member knows what to do when encountering one: the younger children act as bait, the older ones determine the size of the force fields and Filaments with sticks, some light fires to chase away the swarms of fleas, while others hack their way to the epicenter and kill the Psychokinetic.

Day by day, the tribes lose their young adults to melting pots like Tripol. The Psychovores get the rest. The elders resist. They involve the young people more strongly, let them lead the hunt, give them whites to beat, or concubines to enjoy. Old rules are re-interpreted and defended against the coca-intoxicated elders.</p>\n<p>However, even one dead sparrow hawk on the village square can be considered a bad omen and thus destroy any progress, lead a Clan back to its old ways, and ossify in tradition. However, the loss of the young is not the only danger. The Psychovores spread and steal habitats from humans. Scouts report that the Psychovores make room for humans even deep in the jungle. Giant circular areas rot within hours – but who can tell if this vesicular decay is not merely part of the circle of life? Who knows what the next cycle may bring?</p>\n<p>Some Clans have the courage to settle amidst the strange vegetation. They move on when the circle is closed.</p>\n<p>Some keep going further south. No one ever hears from them again. Those who stick to the growth line can harvest Psychovore seeds and fruit that earn some good Dinars from the Scourgers.</p>\n<p>Still, Clans organize a resistance. They burn down the Psychovore stolons and salt the burnt areas. The Spitalians who now reside in Qabis, examining the Psychovore wall’s route, think this is a bad idea. The Psychovores act like an organism, wincing when in pain but growing all the faster elsewhere, developing strategies, adapting. Every single area is freed at a high cost. Many Clans lose their homes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":600000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>They lend us a hand and help us on the fields without asking for anything in return.

They had already had to leave behind their relatives. The survivors devised a rescue plan so absurd it could have only been conceived in that time of flamboyant gestures and actions: they wanted to build a bridge across the Reaper’s Blow, across Purgatory itself.</p>\n<p>Men and women worked hard day by day, only protected from the heat of the magma bubble below them by flimsy asbestos suits.

A year before, recon specialists had first managed to cross the Reaper’s Blow. However, their expectations were not met. Two sections in which the Hellvetics had hoped to find their high command and the government’s representatives had caved in. Not even ashes remained. Should all the sweat, all the blood have been in vain? The military apparatus teetered. Throughout these years, it had clung to this single goal, now its heart and its brain had been ripped from its body. Empty and burnt-out, it stared into a bleak future.</p>\n<p>The Hellvetic Leonhard Gboy managed to save the day. A rationing plan and several improvised leadership institutions caught the survivors in a net of bureaucracy and new goals. A Corps Commander who had to guarantee the area’s safety autonomously was assigned to all of the Swiss Territorial Regions. He commanded smaller units of a few dozen soldiers that were supposed to be constantly checked for quality by an independent section commission. The chain of command was restored, and the Hellvetics felt like they were part of a Swiss clockwork machine again. One thing remained to be done. They drew a line under the past and almost unanimously voted for proudly carrying the name Hellvetics from now on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>FROM HELL TO HELL</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.timeline.6j15f1Nl0YjS6WgD.JournalEntryPage.qfUsbMegTaj75xA4#2082-━-mother-nature-hibernates]{2082}</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Before the fall, they went into the mountain convinced they would have to confront the Eshaton’s suffering and destruction only weeks later with joint forces.

They granted them quick trials that ended in the choice between death or exile. Many a war criminal and bandit fled into Northern Borca in those days and continued their reign of terror there. <strong>That was acceptable to the Hellvetics, for they were never interested in a better world.

These transfer tunnels allowed strangers to pass under the Alps and the Reaper’s Blow, for a fee. Anabaptists could cross the Alpine passes from Borca to Purgare.

From this arose various responsibilities, jobs and goals for the respective Hellvetics of each Region. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">While Territorial Region I in the Frankan Alps only has to guarantee the passes’ safety and the protection of Torino, Territorial Region II is responsible for the former cantons. They were considered under military occupation for a long time – an interim solution in force for many centuries. According to the Doctrine, the heartland was to be supported by a democratic government after the ancient Swiss fashion, but this development was rejected by the Hellvetics as anarchistic and non-democratic, along with not being suitable for the current situation. Only in Bern was there an independent representation of the people that was not allowed to raise a militia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Now the Hellvetics have left the cantons to their own devices.

No one knew for sure where the rocks would come down if the Paladin satellites missed them, or only shot them into smaller fragments. Switzerland was in danger, and thus, they needed a Plan B.</p>\n<p>The Alpine Fortress’s bunker complexes were the obvious choice for storing cultural treasures, but they could also guarantee the survival of the Swiss – Swiss who would be able to retake control after the collapse of all public order. Aided by artisans, scientists, sociologists and psychologists, Switzerland should survive culturally and socially even in the event of a total collapse. Alongside civilians, the government sent a contingent of career soldiers to the bunkers, over 2000 men and women. They would take care with an orderly takeover and protect Switzerland’s borders.</p>\n<p>For more than a year, army vehicles transported food, computers, miles of cables and installations into the Alpine Fortress. The selection process began.

Those left behind felt cheated and angry against the supposed betrayers, driven by their own fear, while the bunker crew had to resign in helplessness. Out there were relatives and acquaintances, many left partners and children to an uncertain fate. Isolation had just begun when the inmates already wanted it to end. However, the catastrophe became the apocalypse. The Reaper’s Blow split the Alps like a divine axe blow. The mountains broke open, stone avalanches splintered from the breaking point, crashed down with a deafening noise and buried rising magma under millions of tons of stone, a fragile seal on Pandora’s Box. The Alpine Fortress was mortally wounded. The great access gates caved in or were buried under rubble. Tunnels that had led into hangars and barracks only yesterday now ended in dizzying heights and opened onto newly formed valleys. Deep black, toxic columns of smoke curled skywards, searing heat welled up. The mountain had become a prison.</p>\n<p>Complete sections were cut off from the core, the fate of the Swiss living there was unknown. Most of the castaways belonged to the civilian branch and were responsible for the reconstruction. Without them…</p>\n<p>The military fought on, unwilling to give up on comrades and civilians. They had already had to leave behind their relatives. The survivors devised a rescue plan so absurd it could have only been conceived in that time of flamboyant gestures and actions: they wanted to build a bridge across the Reaper’s Blow, across Purgatory itself.</p>\n<p>Men and women worked hard day by day, only protected from the heat of the magma bubble below them by flimsy asbestos suits. They went through hell, and what started as a grim joke soon became commonly used.</p>\n<p>They called themselves the “Hellvetics”.</p>\n<p>The first of six bridges was finished in 2076. A year before, recon specialists had first managed to cross the Reaper’s Blow. However, their expectations were not met. Two sections in which the Hellvetics had hoped to find their high command and the government’s representatives had caved in. Not even ashes remained. Should all the sweat, all the blood have been in vain? The military apparatus teetered. Throughout these years, it had clung to this single goal, now its heart and its brain had been ripped from its body. Empty and burnt-out, it stared into a bleak future.</p>\n<p>The Hellvetic Leonhard Gboy managed to save the day. A rationing plan and several improvised leadership institutions caught the survivors in a net of bureaucracy and new goals. A Corps Commander who had to guarantee the area’s safety autonomously was assigned to all of the Swiss Territorial Regions. He commanded smaller units of a few dozen soldiers that were supposed to be constantly checked for quality by an independent section commission. The chain of command was restored, and the Hellvetics felt like they were part of a Swiss clockwork machine again. One thing remained to be done. They drew a line under the past and almost unanimously voted for proudly carrying the name Hellvetics from now on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>FROM HELL TO HELL</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.timeline.6j15f1Nl0YjS6WgD.JournalEntryPage.qfUsbMegTaj75xA4#2082-━-mother-nature-hibernates]{2082}</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Before the fall, they went into the mountain convinced they would have to confront the Eshaton’s suffering and destruction only weeks later with joint forces.

These transfer tunnels allowed strangers to pass under the Alps and the Reaper’s Blow, for a fee. Anabaptists could cross the Alpine passes from Borca to Purgare.

They were considered under military occupation for a long time – an interim solution in force for many centuries. According to the Doctrine, the heartland was to be supported by a democratic government after the ancient Swiss fashion, but this development was rejected by the Hellvetics as anarchistic and non-democratic, along with not being suitable for the current situation. Only in Bern was there an independent representation of the people that was not allowed to raise a militia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Now the Hellvetics have left the cantons to their own devices.

One legend has been told throughout the centuries: Triglaw. Ancient records tell of a grotesquely stunted man in billowing layers of white fabrics who roams the Hellvetics’ tunnels. He is extraordinarily cunning, takes whatever he wants from stores, and, if you believe the first sighting, must be at least 400 years old. Many of the tales concerning him are more than absurd. He is said to have supplied the Swiss with the asbestos suits for building the bridges. His decaying body is said to be the soulless husk of one of the first Hellvetics. He is even said to be the original protector of the Alps and a last relic of the Bygone people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">If even a few of the rumors about Triglaw are true, the history of Hellvetica itself will have to be rewritten.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>GRADES</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first grades, Soldier, Private and Lance Corporal, are the beginning.

The responsibilities grow. He has to prove himself by leading platoons made up of several Hellvetic squads.

He told them that God would come upon the world in anger, to purge it from lazy faithlessness. To pass it on to his disciples, the descendants of their progenitor Abraham so that the Seed may sprout and the land may flourish in faith.</p>\n<p>Then God crushed the world with silence and dust.</p>\n<p>The years that passed were tough, life was hard and nearly unbearable for everyone, even for those who had looked for the covenant with the last prophet. But the flames of faith burned on. Small tribes and families helped each other, rebuilding in the knowledge that they were God’s chosen children. As promised by Jehammed, a huge land spread before them that they could pacify and settle until the last prophet would return to his fold.</p>\n<p>Many followers of the Cult lost their faith in the era of the beast, gave in to the ferociousness of their urges and joined the unleashed masses of the Apocalyptics. But the Righteous Ones remained faithful. As if in a fever, they struggled through the dark days after God’s judgment day, their faces cast down in humility and in the knowledge that the eyes of the Lord were trained on them. They mastered husbandry and crafts, kept clean and took good care of themselves to keep plague and illness away from their families. They forged weapons and armor from Bygone scrap, avoided the barbarity of the simpletons and the faithless. They proudly called themselves Jehammedans. With the name came unity: they wore it like a war banner, and the faithful flocked to it. The community grew to a giant extended family that offered protection to its members – and demanded awe from its enemies.</p>\n<p>The Jehammedans spread from the Balkhan to Borca and Hybrispania and flourished where other Clans died. In the early years, they gathered all those under the roof of the faith who felt homeless and stranded in the wasteland and adhered to Jehammed’s laws.</p>\n<p>In the heart of the Balkhan, on the ruins of old Bucharest, the new center of the Jehammedan faith arose. Borcan Osman, the city of the sickle tower, converted within a few days after the Jehammedans’ ancient Iconides entered the gates and declared the covenant with God. In Hybrispania, the Cult came to reign over Castile.</p>\n<p>Its warriors, the Swords of Jehammed, were received tearfully as blessed avenging angels.

When the Anabaptists finally took up their arms, a conflict arose that couldn’t have been much crueler. The life-giving Adriatic soon was adorned with piles of corpses on the Purgan side. Just like Cain, the farmer, had killed his brother Abel, the shepherd, the Jehammedans felt victimized. The Anabaptists attacked them, raped them, killed them, smashed what the Jehammedans had built with the diligence of a thousand hands in the centuries after the Eshaton.

He stands in the progenitor Abraham’s tradition and bears the honorary title of Abrami. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As Abraham took a young slave to procreate, the Abrami takes a wife – the Hagari – to keep his house and be the mother of his children. The daughters prepare for their lives as Hagaris and help their mother, while the sons herd the flock, provide water, and guard the tents – as Jehammed decreed for an Ismaeli. Life doesn’t offer any grandeur. Only when they join the Jehammedan ranks as Swords of Jehammed, they can excel. If they prove themselves, they are allowed to found their own family as Abramis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Although the Hagari births children to the Abrami, she’s not considered his primary wife. For this the Abrami chooses a Saraeli, a virgin creature, strong and pure in her faith. Once in the cycle from spring to winter, the Abrami and the Saraeli share a bed. If a son arises from this union, the joy is boundless: the Lord has blessed the clan with an Isaaki!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This son is clad in the richest fabrics and surrounded by fatherly love. He gets the best piece of the lamb and sits next to the Abrami, but he’s also taught how to use the saber and how to ride. Day in, day out, he shapes his body and soul to be a perfect vessel of devotion to God. He is the sacrificial lamb that the family will offer to the Lord on the battlefield. There will be many opportunities for this; he rides into battle after battle. The Isaaki leads the host, galloping in front of them into the enemy ranks, a blazing example of faith and dedication. Very few live to reach their thirtieth winter, and only if God wills. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">But sometimes the Lord rejects the sacrifice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Such an Isaaki’s life’s work is not yet done: the Council of Elders makes him an Iconide, and as such, he will then lead the Cult and mark the way that God has prepared for the Jehammedans.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ICONIDES</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just as Abraham bargained with God to save the sinful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Iconides bargain for the Jehammedans’ future.

He fills two cups with sugared tea from a samovar and carries them to a low round table at the center of the room. He places one cup where he’s going to sit and the other on the opposite side, where his imaginary bargaining partner takes a seat. Chanting softly to praise God’s deeds, he is invited in.</p>\n<p>The Iconide waits patiently, sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. He meditates until he becomes aware of God. Then he brings over a small box inlaid with gold, places it at the center of the table, and opens it. Wrapped in velvet, there is a so-called Icon – a symbol for the deal.</p>\n<p>The Iconide explains to the Lord what it symbolizes: the skull of a Jehammedan torn apart by machine-gun fire stands for the wish to punish an emplacement of Scourgers with death and destruction, with the severed hand of a thief the Iconide pushes for quiet and order in a rebel village, gazing at a piece of concrete from Tripol he discusses a flood to punish the sinful city, and a broken sword is intended to lead to an Isaaki who is considered lost back to the temple of the community.</p>\n<p>The Iconide sits and recounts all the sacrifices he and his family had to make. He counts them like bills, thus buying the Icon’s symbolic value. Usually, the deal ends with old Saraelis dragging the unconscious Iconide outside to breathe fresh air and regain consciousness. He is marked by lack of sleep and food and will have to rest for days. Next comes the waiting and watching. Did he win the bargaining? What are his conditions and restrictions? It is up to the Iconide to interpret the results that reach him via messengers. Does the flood come from a devastating downpour? Does the leader of the revolt die by his concubine’s hand? Will the Swords of Jehammed be needed to exercise God’s will at the Scourger emplacement?</p>\n<p>Usually, it takes months or years before the family can be sure. If the bargain is kept, the Icon becomes a relic. If it is denied, God will have had his reasons not to fulfill the Iconide’s wish.

Stone buildings would only produce a false impression of security where alertness would be preferred. Stone is property, and a lot of property would produce haughtiness where humility would be preferred. In the scroll “The Last Days,” Jehammed implores his followers to keep moving. To sleep in tents and to avoid the stone deserts. To prefer the ram to the cornfield. To leave everything behind and make a new camp at the end of the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">For centuries, his faithful heeded his counsel.

Judges and Anabaptists claim large areas. When a group of people travels through a foreign domain in the Balkhan, hundreds of fighters rise up at the behest of the Voivodes. In spite of Jehammed’s commandment, the Jehammedans had to stake their claim and sometimes fortify or defend their land. Many have settled down.

In doing so, the Iconides revolt against the word of Jehammed: he has ordered to cut off any hand that rises against the family, be it a foreigner’s or a brother’s. The Iconides are desperate. They never had to fear an enemy within. There is no counsel on that in their scrolls. Honorable Iconides unwilling to characterize Aries as a corrupt false God and deny his worshipers God’s mercy make their fight even harder.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ARIANOI</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nAfter the battle in the Adriatic basin, Aries and his newly recruited followers disappeared without a trace. Rumor has it that he went to Crete, where he was born. These days, the Jehammedans only hear bad news from the island. Rams’ heads and skinned, impaled Africans should be warning enough for anyone who consider approaching its shores. The inhabitants of the coast claim that the Arianoi, Aries’ messengers and Prophets of the Ram, allow no foreigners on their holy ground. <br /><br />Actually, there are several eyewitness reports from Neolibyans who floundered on Crete’s dark shores at night. They could not help but watch the terrible orgies that took place inland next to temples and bizarre labyrinths of scrap and bones. The tales of torchlight and squealing lambs staggering around in a circle of ram-headed men with open jugulars seem far-fetched. For a long time, the Scourgers laughed about the Neolibyan Wamai who claimed to have watched this gruesome spectacle. Then the Gimbya, a 500-ton transporter, ran ashore close to Tobruk on the Neolibyan coast. There were no survivors on board. The Neolibyans and Scourgers had been disemboweled and skinned. Rams’ heads were piled on the deck. The Neolibyans may rule the Mediterranean, but they have given Crete a wide berth ever since. <br /><br />The truth about Aries and his Arianoi goes much deeper than simple tales of bloody orgies. The few Arianoi who revealed themselves to their brothers in Bucharest paint a completely different picture. While Jehammed separated the Cult from the world to enable its survival, Aries is going to bring it full circle and reconcile the Jehammedans with the world. He wants them to set out, see with open eyes the miracles that they could not experience from the confinement of their clan. Leave the defensive, start attacking, use their strength to liberate Bucharest and conquer Justitian. Take the Arianois’ hands. They know the way, you children of fishermen. <br /><br />Do they still not know who Aries really is?</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":100000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"grfBXH2AJeInrsiw","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/cultcard_jehammedan.png","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>The old hatred fades.

The scimitar rises and falls; every hit is a wound, every gaze finds new targets in the sea of opponents.<br /><br />“Jehammed!” he cries, and a hundred brothers in faith answer with shouted prayers of devotion. The rider turns his black horse around, flanking towards the enemy camp. The corona of pinned-up hair comes down in the headwind. Tattooed marks adorn his skin: on his forehead they meet to form a complex pattern that sings a silent song of an exalted ancestry and countless battles<br /><br />The hooves thunder, the horse snorts, its crest flies in the wind. The Jehammedan presses against the shivering body, kicking the horse’s flanks. He rides like hell, and looking back he sees his men skirmishing with the foul Anabaptists. It’s a losing battle. 300 feet to the enemies’ tents, 300 feet through a thicket of swords and war spades to kill the Anabaptists’ fat leader. Only his death can turn the tide and win the day for the Swords of Jehammed<br /><br />200 feet. The warrior chants his Iconide’s prayers, batting aside swords. The Baptist’s bodyguards form a dark line in front of him. Furors. He grips his blade tighter, strikes out, hits, hears spear shafts breaking, feels dirt and splinters in his face. He’s destined to die for others to live, for he is an Isaaki. He is the sacrificial lamb...</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\">CULTURES</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cultures.DSdkF6rOf3lVN18Z]{Borca}</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cultures.o1Cszc2PLHYGpW0i]{Balkhan}</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.cultures.kdhSnsohRc3jTzi7]{Hybrispania}</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;padding:6px\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\">TECH LEVEL</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">⏵@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.utilities.vULmkmnGtLFZ86mr.JournalEntryPage.l0IcIdAwXaD0bdrH]{TECH II: MEDIEVAL}</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:solid;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;text-align:left;padding:6px\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\">NOMEN EST OMEN</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use the Old Testament and add the birth rank as family name.

He was a shining dream, replete with God, his voice thundered down on the people and made them feel the power of his Lord. He told them that God would come upon the world in anger, to purge it from lazy faithlessness. To pass it on to his disciples, the descendants of their progenitor Abraham so that the Seed may sprout and the land may flourish in faith.</p>\n<p>Then God crushed the world with silence and dust.</p>\n<p>The years that passed were tough, life was hard and nearly unbearable for everyone, even for those who had looked for the covenant with the last prophet. But the flames of faith burned on. Small tribes and families helped each other, rebuilding in the knowledge that they were God’s chosen children. As promised by Jehammed, a huge land spread before them that they could pacify and settle until the last prophet would return to his fold.</p>\n<p>Many followers of the Cult lost their faith in the era of the beast, gave in to the ferociousness of their urges and joined the unleashed masses of the Apocalyptics. But the Righteous Ones remained faithful. As if in a fever, they struggled through the dark days after God’s judgment day, their faces cast down in humility and in the knowledge that the eyes of the Lord were trained on them. They mastered husbandry and crafts, kept clean and took good care of themselves to keep plague and illness away from their families. They forged weapons and armor from Bygone scrap, avoided the barbarity of the simpletons and the faithless. They proudly called themselves Jehammedans. With the name came unity: they wore it like a war banner, and the faithful flocked to it. The community grew to a giant extended family that offered protection to its members – and demanded awe from its enemies.</p>\n<p>The Jehammedans spread from the Balkhan to Borca and Hybrispania and flourished where other Clans died. In the early years, they gathered all those under the roof of the faith who felt homeless and stranded in the wasteland and adhered to Jehammed’s laws.</p>\n<p>In the heart of the Balkhan, on the ruins of old Bucharest, the new center of the Jehammedan faith arose. Borcan Osman, the city of the sickle tower, converted within a few days after the Jehammedans’ ancient Iconides entered the gates and declared the covenant with God. In Hybrispania, the Cult came to reign over Castile.</p>\n<p>Its warriors, the Swords of Jehammed, were received tearfully as blessed avenging angels.

When the Anabaptists finally took up their arms, a conflict arose that couldn’t have been much crueler. The life-giving Adriatic soon was adorned with piles of corpses on the Purgan side. Just like Cain, the farmer, had killed his brother Abel, the shepherd, the Jehammedans felt victimized. The Anabaptists attacked them, raped them, killed them, smashed what the Jehammedans had built with the diligence of a thousand hands in the centuries after the Eshaton. Humiliated, they jumped into the waters and retreated to the east bank. The Anabaptists also crossed, to exterminate their enemies.</p>\n<p>But in the darkest hour, the tide turned.</p>\n<p>Aries the Ram appeared in the Iconides’ tents.</p>\n<p>No one knew this stranger, but he promised to destroy the enemy souls, for his anger was tremendous and old. The Jehammedans let him do as he pleased, and the foreign warrior lead their troops. The wind of revenge came over the Anabaptists like a roaring blizzard, the occupied areas of the East Adriatic plain were reconquered with a thousand saber cuts, and the enemy who had already felt victorious was killed, beheaded, and defiled. On the Adriatic Sea, the enemy armies clashed one final time, then settled in for a hundred years of cold war afterwards.

How is the herd supposed to ever exist in peace if heart and soul have to fight for their place? It is up to the married man and father to lead the tribe in worldly and spiritual affairs. He stands in the progenitor Abraham’s tradition and bears the honorary title of Abrami. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As Abraham took a young slave to procreate, the Abrami takes a wife – the Hagari – to keep his house and be the mother of his children. The daughters prepare for their lives as Hagaris and help their mother, while the sons herd the flock, provide water, and guard the tents – as Jehammed decreed for an Ismaeli. Life doesn’t offer any grandeur. Only when they join the Jehammedan ranks as Swords of Jehammed, they can excel. If they prove themselves, they are allowed to found their own family as Abramis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Although the Hagari births children to the Abrami, she’s not considered his primary wife. For this the Abrami chooses a Saraeli, a virgin creature, strong and pure in her faith. Once in the cycle from spring to winter, the Abrami and the Saraeli share a bed. If a son arises from this union, the joy is boundless: the Lord has blessed the clan with an Isaaki!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">This son is clad in the richest fabrics and surrounded by fatherly love. He gets the best piece of the lamb and sits next to the Abrami, but he’s also taught how to use the saber and how to ride. Day in, day out, he shapes his body and soul to be a perfect vessel of devotion to God. He is the sacrificial lamb that the family will offer to the Lord on the battlefield. There will be many opportunities for this; he rides into battle after battle. The Isaaki leads the host, galloping in front of them into the enemy ranks, a blazing example of faith and dedication. Very few live to reach their thirtieth winter, and only if God wills. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">But sometimes the Lord rejects the sacrifice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Such an Isaaki’s life’s work is not yet done: the Council of Elders makes him an Iconide, and as such, he will then lead the Cult and mark the way that God has prepared for the Jehammedans.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ICONIDES</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just as Abraham bargained with God to save the sinful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Iconides bargain for the Jehammedans’ future. To do so, the Iconide retreats to his chambers, burning incense and sandalwood. Then he washes his feet according to the ancient rites and dries them thoroughly. He fills two cups with sugared tea from a samovar and carries them to a low round table at the center of the room. He places one cup where he’s going to sit and the other on the opposite side, where his imaginary bargaining partner takes a seat. Chanting softly to praise God’s deeds, he is invited in.</p>\n<p>The Iconide waits patiently, sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. He meditates until he becomes aware of God. Then he brings over a small box inlaid with gold, places it at the center of the table, and opens it. Wrapped in velvet, there is a so-called Icon – a symbol for the deal.</p>\n<p>The Iconide explains to the Lord what it symbolizes: the skull of a Jehammedan torn apart by machine-gun fire stands for the wish to punish an emplacement of Scourgers with death and destruction, with the severed hand of a thief the Iconide pushes for quiet and order in a rebel village, gazing at a piece of concrete from Tripol he discusses a flood to punish the sinful city, and a broken sword is intended to lead to an Isaaki who is considered lost back to the temple of the community.</p>\n<p>The Iconide sits and recounts all the sacrifices he and his family had to make. He counts them like bills, thus buying the Icon’s symbolic value. Usually, the deal ends with old Saraelis dragging the unconscious Iconide outside to breathe fresh air and regain consciousness. He is marked by lack of sleep and food and will have to rest for days. Next comes the waiting and watching. Did he win the bargaining? What are his conditions and restrictions? It is up to the Iconide to interpret the results that reach him via messengers. Does the flood come from a devastating downpour? Does the leader of the revolt die by his concubine’s hand? Will the Swords of Jehammed be needed to exercise God’s will at the Scourger emplacement?</p>\n<p>Usually, it takes months or years before the family can be sure. If the bargain is kept, the Icon becomes a relic. If it is denied, God will have had his reasons not to fulfill the Iconide’s wish.

The bigger and healthier the herd, the more Ismaeli the progenitor can sire to add to his wealth and influence. Having many children has always been considered a sign of God’s favor by the Jehammedans: Abramis blessed thus are very respected.

The fat is used to produce candles or torches, from the innards the Ismaelis craft strings for their bows.

Stone is property, and a lot of property would produce haughtiness where humility would be preferred. In the scroll “The Last Days,” Jehammed implores his followers to keep moving.

In spite of Jehammed’s commandment, the Jehammedans had to stake their claim and sometimes fortify or defend their land. Many have settled down.

Rumor has it that he went to Crete, where he was born. These days, the Jehammedans only hear bad news from the island. Rams’ heads and skinned, impaled Africans should be warning enough for anyone who consider approaching its shores. The inhabitants of the coast claim that the Arianoi, Aries’ messengers and Prophets of the Ram, allow no foreigners on their holy ground. <br /><br />Actually, there are several eyewitness reports from Neolibyans who floundered on Crete’s dark shores at night. They could not help but watch the terrible orgies that took place inland next to temples and bizarre labyrinths of scrap and bones. The tales of torchlight and squealing lambs staggering around in a circle of ram-headed men with open jugulars seem far-fetched. For a long time, the Scourgers laughed about the Neolibyan Wamai who claimed to have watched this gruesome spectacle. Then the Gimbya, a 500-ton transporter, ran ashore close to Tobruk on the Neolibyan coast. There were no survivors on board. The Neolibyans and Scourgers had been disemboweled and skinned. Rams’ heads were piled on the deck. The Neolibyans may rule the Mediterranean, but they have given Crete a wide berth ever since. <br /><br />The truth about Aries and his Arianoi goes much deeper than simple tales of bloody orgies. The few Arianoi who revealed themselves to their brothers in Bucharest paint a completely different picture. While Jehammed separated the Cult from the world to enable its survival, Aries is going to bring it full circle and reconcile the Jehammedans with the world. He wants them to set out, see with open eyes the miracles that they could not experience from the confinement of their clan. Leave the defensive, start attacking, use their strength to liberate Bucharest and conquer Justitian. Take the Arianois’ hands. They know the way, you children of fishermen. <br /><br />Do they still not know who Aries really is?</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":100000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"grfBXH2AJeInrsiw","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/cultcard_jehammedan.png","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>The old hatred fades.

They attacked each other over handfuls of corn, killing and looting. Some claimed their circumstances were to blame. Centuries of ethical and moral development were gone with the wind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Soon, the first gangs appeared. They promised safety as long as they were stronger and fiercer than their competitors. The individual was a helpless victim of their violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">One man led the people back to the path of righteousness. He called himself “the Judge”. He first appeared in 2381 in a small, fortified village close to the ruins of Bochum. There he apprehended a Clanner who had been wounded and left behind after a raid. He recited his crimes, theft being the smallest among them, and led him to the executioner’s block, an upturned iron bucket. The Judge fixed the delinquent’s head to the tin with his foot and smashed his head with one blow of his sledgehammer. There was no axe to be found in the village. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The onlookers were shocked. </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Yes, they had savored the captive’s fear of death after the suffering he had brought upon the village. But did it have to be so brutal? The Judge remained impassive. He adjusted his broadrimmed floppy hat, looked down the greasy hem of his cowhide coat spattered with blood, brain matter, and pieces of bone, and asked for a bowl of water. The hammer he offered back to the farmer who had lent it to him, but the man only shook his head. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">From now on, the villagers saw the Judge more often. He journeyed from settlement to settlement. With the patience of a snake waiting for its prey he mediated altercations between villagers and took on the work he was known and feared for: he judged. Whenever he arrived the villagers already awaited him with prisoners and told him about their crimes. His judgments were merciless, but just, his executions brutal and grim. His trademark floppy hat, the glasses, the coat and hammer were all soon known throughout West Borca. He was a figure of law, order, and deterrence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">He became a living legend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Judge cut a bloody swath through the landscape of Clans and outlaws. They resisted. They ambushed him, attacked him with two, three and finally four people. Hundreds of times the Judge went down, dragged from his horse, shot and kicked. But he was cunning and tough, kept getting up again, smashed stupidly gawking faces with his hammer, broke shins and rammed the heft into innards and eyes. He always won. His aura of righteous revenge finally started attracting young, enthusiastic people. At first they nourished him, warned him, and brought him information. In the end, they joined him, followed him and protected him on his crusade against all the scum.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>STONE HEADS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">It is a tradition amongst the Judges to immure a Supreme Judge’s mortal remains together with the Codex he wrote in a giant stone head built taller than a man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">23 of these monuments are lined up along the Judgement Alley in Justitian, looking gravely down onto a new generation of Judges.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>GUARDIANS OF ORDER</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soon, he had over 100 followers.

Two Judges waited in the central plaza, their collars upturned, rubbing their hands. A hooded figure approached. Chronicler Metatag, as agreed.

Through the feedback of his amp, he shouted “The Testament!” and disappeared again in the swirling snow without turning back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The two Judges held in their hands the First One’s travel diary, holding his collected experiences, epigrams and pages full of paragraphs.

The Judges’ reputed ability to put up a fight should be enough to keep lawless rabble away.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>They all accepted, fortified the wells that the Chroniclers had kept hidden so far and expanded the old buildings. But not all of them were happy. To the Advocates, as the theorists were called now, the stone holds offered everything they needed for their studies of texts and their proliferation. To the old-fashioned Judges who wanted to beat the word of law into the faces of fat criminals with an iron fist, the Protectors, the nascent city was a corset hindering their movement. They made the best of it, even if they disliked the centralization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The city prospered and grew and was called Justitian, in honor of Justitia, the goddess of justice – another Chronicler idea. They were part of everything, crept into meetings and counseled without being asked. Due to their influence, one Judge arose and made a bid for power. Justus I was the first in the long tradition of Supreme Judges of Justitian. He elevated his own version of the Testament to a universally valid law and called it “the Codex”. He ordered the Advocates to make laws and asked the Protectors to apply them in the field. To each his own. Internal strife he countered with a hierarchy making clear who was right in the end. From now on, lesser and higher Judges rode through the city, and Vagrants and Enforcers guarded the gates. The groundwork was laid. Now it was time to build a monument upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Years later, the Judges ruled over the majority of West Borca. Settlements and farms joined the Justitian Protectorate. Give up independence for safety, maybe even leadership. After decades of fighting for survival, it was an easy choice for most people.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE CODEX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Every Supreme Judge enters into office with his own Codex. Time moves on, and the outlaws’ imagination seems endless. Beyond the Testament’s clear, fundamental rules, there is a need for clarification which has often caused aggravation in recent years. The text is fairly close to the people, it is something like a contract between the inhabitants of Justitian and the Judges. At least this is how it was in the beginning. For the Codex evolves, amended by the Advocates’ interpretations. The longer a Supreme Judge is in office, the more complex and tight the web of paragraphs becomes. Archot is the oldest of them all. He has been Supreme Judge for more than 20 years, and his Codex has become a bloated monster that no one can control anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Basic commandments like “Thou shalt not kill” and “Thou shalt not steal” form the smallest, but oldest part of the Codex. The subsidiary paragraphs list pages and pages of exceptions and measures of punishment. Then come the rules concerning strife of any kind, taken from an enormous measure of precedence cases: adultery, fraud, imposture, malpractice and much more – every eventuality is covered by paragraphs. The outside world clauses describe procedure outside the city in great detail, defining the rights and dues of Judges and people foreign to the Protectorate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">While the Advocates devise new laws in their palaces and keep an army of scribes occupied with a flood of amendments to the Codex, the Protectors out in the streets of Justitian face a dark future. Only a few older ones remember the times when the handy booklet wrapped in black leather gave them direction, but did not force them to rush down the slope like a train on brakeless tracks. There is no room for interpretation anymore. Everything that could be interpreted has been interpreted and set in stone.

However, Archot loves those irate discussions, for they inspire his mind.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>JUDGES' LINGO</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The founder’s Testament was riddled with Latin and Greek phrases and epigrams. Much of it remained incomprehensible for a long time, those ancient languages were too foreign. Although the text has been completely deciphered by now and the Cult has excellent experts on linguistics, the Judges never felt compelled to make Latin their official language. Bringing the law to the people was challenging enough: the people have to understand the laws to accept the Codex, so the Protectors thought. The Advocates, on the other hand, see their position threatened. If the people understand and internalize the laws, what would they need the Judges for? This conflict between Protectors and Advocates is as old as the Cult itself and has always been a subject of discussion in Justitian’s Senates. So far, the Senates have been canceling each other out: traditionally, the Supreme Judge is the one to bring about a decision by voting.</span></p>\n<br />Some Latin words have managed to wiggle their way into the Judges’ language: for example, the Supreme Judge is often called “Primus inter pares”, first among peers. The trial is being held “Coram publico”, in public, the defendants are called into the stand with the phrase “Audiatur et altera pars!” (The other side shall be heard too!), and Protectors get in the right mood for the coming battle with “Per Aspera ad Astra” (through hardships, to the stars). Many a Judge finishes his final sentence with “Punctum!” (That’s it!) or starts a death sentence with “Mors certa, hora incerta.” (Death is certain, its hour is uncertain), and almost every second sentence of the opinion of the court can be spiced up by a “De iure” (by right). <br /><br />Some Judges would feel naked if they didn’t wear this garb of unintelligible phrases. Others completely refrain from using the Latin clichés. As far as the Cult is concerned, that is up to the Judges alone.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>JURYMEN</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Protectorate thrives and grows quicker than the number of its Judges.

Mostly, they choose enclave leaders or merchants with a good reputation, less often decorated veterans who are schooled as Jurymen in a fast-track procedure. They can pass Judgements in the absence of Judges and arrest culprits until the Judge can review their case. If a culprit accepts the temporary Judgment, it becomes valid and irreversible. Lesser punishments like the marking of a thief or liar are implemented at once by a Juryman or his representative. In more severe cases, a Protector must be consulted.<br /></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AN EYE FOR AN EYE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Judges bring law to the wasteland, and just like a strict father teaches the rules of life to his unruly kids by beating them, the Judges punish all who act against the Codex’s teachings. Punishment is not an end in itself, but a tool to frighten the masses and lead them on the path to purity, so the First Judge writes in his journal.</span></p>\n<br />Thus, the Judges have developed many forms of reproof, castigation, and harsh punishments for every crime during the long years of their existence. They know no imprisonment, though. Justitian was not willing to shoulder the cost for arresting and feeding a prisoner for days or even months. <br /><br />The Judges’ penal system also needs to take into account that the people in the Protectorate are practically anonymous. No one has ever heard of passports or birth certificates. If you move house within Justitian, you can start a new life as a stranger in the new neighborhood. The Judges counteracted this by making punishments visible. For example, a thief’s hands and forearms are dyed blue using a stinking solution. The same color is used to mark the lips of liars and frauds. Depending on the mixture, this color takes weeks or months to fade. The culprits then get rid of the social anathema and get a second chance. Repeat offenders who are still marked are treated more harshly by the Judges and soon feel the iron fist of Justitian’s justice. Thieves have one knuckle on each hand smashed, frauds get their tongue split with a glowing blade. They should have taken the admonition to heart. <br /><br />Killers and rapists do not get a second chance. Their forehead is branded using a Judgment iron, and they are banned from the Protectorate. Should they return to be arrested, the Judges leave it to the victims or their relatives to choose the punishment. Popular forms of punishment are smashing a limb with the Judgment hammer or tearing it out using the Judge’s horse. In especially severe cases, there is a death sentence and the culprit is killed by a heavy blow to the head. <br /><br />Many culprits, especially those guilty of lesser crimes, get to choose. Either pay an indemnification to their victims or spend a few days in Justitian’s labour camps. Additionally, their faces are marked with red color, the henna. In the following days, they work for the city’s benefit, repair streets, build houses, shovel dirt from the Defiler Streets, fight the dust with their spades, and work on the great Colossus, Chairman Archot’s legacy. If one of them flees and gets caught, he must expect severe repercussions. If the Judges showed mercy, it would be considered weakness. That is something they cannot allow if they want to keep controlling their army of forced laborers. They will treat him like a felon. Only when the henna fades away after two or three weeks may the prisoner go unmolested. A few even stay. Two meals a day are more than they could manage in their normal lives. <br /><br />The Judges’ punishments shape Justitian’s culture. A deal is always sealed by a handshake, before which merchant and customer take off their gloves or wrappings, making sure that the other has no marked skin before getting down to business. Those who wear their gloves on a market in Justitian must expect to be eyed warily. “Show me your hands” is a familiar saying. The same is true for the face. It is considered impolite to hide your face under scarf or breathing mask while in conversation. Why would you do that if not to hide the fact that you are a liar or a fraud? Showing your face is considered tantamount to honesty. Thus, strangers who do not know Justitian’s ways often have a hard time getting started in the Protectorate.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ADVOCATES: CODEX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>BOOK⏵</p>\n<p>TIMELINE⏵</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nThe drill in the dust, the shouting when fighting with the hammers and the eternal din from the Protectors’ sealing block – all this is a permanent nuisance to the Advocates.

A few shots from the rifle, jumping for cover, yes, that’ll do. But they know no leniency concerning the knowledge about the Codex. For hours, the applicant’s knowledge of the paragraphs and laws is checked in a staccato-like cross-examination. Only those who know the Codex by heart and utter the correct phrases without thinking are not found wanting in front of the Advocates’ tribunal. <br /><br />But that’s not all. The last trial is held in the Senate Hall. Extras step up and describe fictional problems, others play the roles of culprits, victims and witnesses. The applicant walks amongst the extras, questioning them and forming an opinion. If his Judgement satisfies the tribunal, he’s almost there. In front of the tribunal, the Judge swears an oath on the Codex and on Justitian, just like the Protectors when they are sworn in. But he will not need his hammer here. The tribunal Judges shake hands with him and congratulate him. It’s a small gesture with huge meaning.

At least, this is what the historians will write. Without using force, his Judges annexed dozens of the villages and erected their Judgement stones all over Borca. The Clans died in the hail of lead from the Judges’ muskets. The Cockroach Clan, savage and bestial as it was, crawled back between the crevices, never to be seen again. The smugglers’ nest called Ignatz was razed in a concerted punitive expedition together with the Preservists. The Judges advanced on all fronts, smashing and rebuilding. Archot himself knew of his magnificence and consciously hid under an insufficient layer of false humility.</span></p>\n<br />If the rumors in the Senate can be believed, Archot feared nothing more than to be forgotten after his death. According to tradition, a stone head would be erected for him next to the Judgement Alley – and thus, he would just be one of a long line of Supreme Judges. It is said he couldn’t stand this notion – and so, it began. He gathered his Advocates and issued a new edict. For his fire to inspire those who came after him, a mausoleum that did his achievements justice should be built for him. The prisoners in the boot camps had a new job. They struggled in the ruins, harvested stones, and dragged them to Justitian’s Uptown. They piled them up at the end of the Judgement Alley: layer by layer, a stone torso formed, passing from a sinewy neck to the chin, tapering at the shoulders. <br /><br />The Colossus towered 30 feet high when a Jehammedan assassin blew it up. <br /><br />More than just a pile of stones were destroyed that day: Archot’s soul crumbled. Someone had to pay. There were witnesses to the attack. A Chronicler Sensorium registered the Hagari shortly before the detonation. The overseers at the Colossus had also seen a female Jehammedan. Archot got word of these facts less than 30 minutes after the attack. He also knew that the Osmani had sent an Isaaki, one of their blessed children, to Justitian. Archot stood on the steps of the Hall of Judgement in his flowing robes, his white hair in disarray and his eyes dark with sadness and hard with fury. “Hang him!” <br /><br />Streamers spread out, trying to warn the Jehammedan community, but they did not reach them. Interface lag. In the end, Rutgar’s Black Judges found the Isaaki, Gideon, and riddled him with 12 rounds of lead. His horse carried him on for more than 50 steps before the corpse slid from the saddle and hit the pavement.<br /><br />Archot decided to hang the Isaaki on a jib a on the Uptown wall. Fodder for the crows and, of course, a sign of his disapproval. <br /><br />An era of strength ended, and Archot’s madness would define the next.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>RETREAT</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Jehammedan Quarter survived, mainly due to the Iconide Baruch who demanded the family council turn their backs on Osman.

Between them, two colossal bronze statues in Judges’ robes tower eight meters high: one is leaning on a hammer, the other presses a dusty image of the Codex to its chest. Their cool gaze rests on the ruin of the Colossus at the end of the Avenue. The Hall of Judgement is rectangular, 80 m long and 50 m wide, a fortress with thick walls and pillars carrying the weight of the inner dome. High, arched windows with artistic glass paintings symbolizing the Judges’ virtues on one side and the outlaws’ deadly sins on the other break up the buildings angular form. The roof is 14 m high, a broad battlement with low bunker towers on all four corners surrounding the whole building. Thick-bellied cannons and mortar mounts stare down onto visitors grimly from above. Behind them, the Protectors patrol.</span></p>\n<br />A one-story concrete building covered in ashlar from pre-Eshaton times clings to the shadowy north flank. Here, the Judges’ horses are stabled. It is said they are better off than some of Justitian’s citizens. In the Hall of Judgement, actually consisting of several vaults, there is a sacral mood. The stained-glass windows break the light into a display of blue, red, and green colored panes. Judges and Chroniclers walk in and out of here all the time: the most important offices can be found in the south wing. The center opens up onto an atrium surrounded by a cloister. Here, Protectors and Advocates meet for friendly discussions. In the main hall, the Supreme Judge resides. In the adjoining side wings, the Senates meet.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE CODEX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">SERVE JUSTICE, </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">SEEK THAT WHICH IS WRONG, </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">THE WORD </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">GIVES US PREMONITION AND SHOWS US THE WAY. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT AWAKENS THE SPIRIT, </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">EXACTS THE CONSCIOUSNESS. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">T</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">HE HAMMER </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">DOES NOT SHOW THE WAY. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT PUNISHES. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT EXORCISES. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT REMOVES. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">CLOAK AND HAT ARE THE SIGNS OF THE COMMUNITY OF THE RIGHTEOUS. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">THEY DEMAND HUMILITY </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">AND ASK FOR RESPECT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">GOGGLES AND SCARF </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ARE THE SHADOW </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">HIDING THE FEAR AND </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">DEFLECTING REVENGE. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">THE MUSKET </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IS LIGHT AND LIGHTNING. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ALL THAT IS FALSE FLEES FROM IT </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">INTO RUIN.<br /></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE BARRACKS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">At strategic points in Justitian, the Judges have erected barracks.

They attacked each other over handfuls of corn, killing and looting. Some claimed their circumstances were to blame. Centuries of ethical and moral development were gone with the wind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Soon, the first gangs appeared. They promised safety as long as they were stronger and fiercer than their competitors. The individual was a helpless victim of their violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">One man led the people back to the path of righteousness. He called himself “the Judge”. He first appeared in 2381 in a small, fortified village close to the ruins of Bochum. There he apprehended a Clanner who had been wounded and left behind after a raid. He recited his crimes, theft being the smallest among them, and led him to the executioner’s block, an upturned iron bucket. The Judge fixed the delinquent’s head to the tin with his foot and smashed his head with one blow of his sledgehammer. There was no axe to be found in the village. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The onlookers were shocked. </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Yes, they had savored the captive’s fear of death after the suffering he had brought upon the village. But did it have to be so brutal? The Judge remained impassive. He adjusted his broadrimmed floppy hat, looked down the greasy hem of his cowhide coat spattered with blood, brain matter, and pieces of bone, and asked for a bowl of water. The hammer he offered back to the farmer who had lent it to him, but the man only shook his head. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">From now on, the villagers saw the Judge more often. He journeyed from settlement to settlement. With the patience of a snake waiting for its prey he mediated altercations between villagers and took on the work he was known and feared for: he judged. Whenever he arrived the villagers already awaited him with prisoners and told him about their crimes. His judgments were merciless, but just, his executions brutal and grim. His trademark floppy hat, the glasses, the coat and hammer were all soon known throughout West Borca. He was a figure of law, order, and deterrence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">He became a living legend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Judge cut a bloody swath through the landscape of Clans and outlaws. They resisted. They ambushed him, attacked him with two, three and finally four people. Hundreds of times the Judge went down, dragged from his horse, shot and kicked. But he was cunning and tough, kept getting up again, smashed stupidly gawking faces with his hammer, broke shins and rammed the heft into innards and eyes. He always won. His aura of righteous revenge finally started attracting young, enthusiastic people. At first they nourished him, warned him, and brought him information. In the end, they joined him, followed him and protected him on his crusade against all the scum.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>STONE HEADS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">It is a tradition amongst the Judges to immure a Supreme Judge’s mortal remains together with the Codex he wrote in a giant stone head built taller than a man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">23 of these monuments are lined up along the Judgement Alley in Justitian, looking gravely down onto a new generation of Judges.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>GUARDIANS OF ORDER</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soon, he had over 100 followers.

The Judges’ reputed ability to put up a fight should be enough to keep lawless rabble away.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>They all accepted, fortified the wells that the Chroniclers had kept hidden so far and expanded the old buildings. But not all of them were happy. To the Advocates, as the theorists were called now, the stone holds offered everything they needed for their studies of texts and their proliferation. To the old-fashioned Judges who wanted to beat the word of law into the faces of fat criminals with an iron fist, the Protectors, the nascent city was a corset hindering their movement. They made the best of it, even if they disliked the centralization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The city prospered and grew and was called Justitian, in honor of Justitia, the goddess of justice – another Chronicler idea. They were part of everything, crept into meetings and counseled without being asked. Due to their influence, one Judge arose and made a bid for power. Justus I was the first in the long tradition of Supreme Judges of Justitian. He elevated his own version of the Testament to a universally valid law and called it “the Codex”. He ordered the Advocates to make laws and asked the Protectors to apply them in the field. To each his own. Internal strife he countered with a hierarchy making clear who was right in the end. From now on, lesser and higher Judges rode through the city, and Vagrants and Enforcers guarded the gates. The groundwork was laid. Now it was time to build a monument upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Years later, the Judges ruled over the majority of West Borca. Settlements and farms joined the Justitian Protectorate. Give up independence for safety, maybe even leadership. After decades of fighting for survival, it was an easy choice for most people.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE CODEX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Every Supreme Judge enters into office with his own Codex. Time moves on, and the outlaws’ imagination seems endless. Beyond the Testament’s clear, fundamental rules, there is a need for clarification which has often caused aggravation in recent years. The text is fairly close to the people, it is something like a contract between the inhabitants of Justitian and the Judges. At least this is how it was in the beginning. For the Codex evolves, amended by the Advocates’ interpretations. The longer a Supreme Judge is in office, the more complex and tight the web of paragraphs becomes. Archot is the oldest of them all. He has been Supreme Judge for more than 20 years, and his Codex has become a bloated monster that no one can control anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Basic commandments like “Thou shalt not kill” and “Thou shalt not steal” form the smallest, but oldest part of the Codex. The subsidiary paragraphs list pages and pages of exceptions and measures of punishment. Then come the rules concerning strife of any kind, taken from an enormous measure of precedence cases: adultery, fraud, imposture, malpractice and much more – every eventuality is covered by paragraphs. The outside world clauses describe procedure outside the city in great detail, defining the rights and dues of Judges and people foreign to the Protectorate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">While the Advocates devise new laws in their palaces and keep an army of scribes occupied with a flood of amendments to the Codex, the Protectors out in the streets of Justitian face a dark future. Only a few older ones remember the times when the handy booklet wrapped in black leather gave them direction, but did not force them to rush down the slope like a train on brakeless tracks. There is no room for interpretation anymore. Everything that could be interpreted has been interpreted and set in stone. The law has become a burden.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE CAMPS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>BOOK⏵</p>\n<p>TIMELINE⏵</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nWhen people speak of the Judges, they usually think of the Protectors.

Much of it remained incomprehensible for a long time, those ancient languages were too foreign. Although the text has been completely deciphered by now and the Cult has excellent experts on linguistics, the Judges never felt compelled to make Latin their official language. Bringing the law to the people was challenging enough: the people have to understand the laws to accept the Codex, so the Protectors thought. The Advocates, on the other hand, see their position threatened. If the people understand and internalize the laws, what would they need the Judges for? This conflict between Protectors and Advocates is as old as the Cult itself and has always been a subject of discussion in Justitian’s Senates. So far, the Senates have been canceling each other out: traditionally, the Supreme Judge is the one to bring about a decision by voting.</span></p>\n<br />Some Latin words have managed to wiggle their way into the Judges’ language: for example, the Supreme Judge is often called “Primus inter pares”, first among peers. The trial is being held “Coram publico”, in public, the defendants are called into the stand with the phrase “Audiatur et altera pars!” (The other side shall be heard too!), and Protectors get in the right mood for the coming battle with “Per Aspera ad Astra” (through hardships, to the stars). Many a Judge finishes his final sentence with “Punctum!” (That’s it!) or starts a death sentence with “Mors certa, hora incerta.” (Death is certain, its hour is uncertain), and almost every second sentence of the opinion of the court can be spiced up by a “De iure” (by right). <br /><br />Some Judges would feel naked if they didn’t wear this garb of unintelligible phrases. Others completely refrain from using the Latin clichés. As far as the Cult is concerned, that is up to the Judges alone.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>JURYMEN</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Protectorate thrives and grows quicker than the number of its Judges.

They can pass Judgements in the absence of Judges and arrest culprits until the Judge can review their case. If a culprit accepts the temporary Judgment, it becomes valid and irreversible.

In more severe cases, a Protector must be consulted.<br /></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AN EYE FOR AN EYE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Judges bring law to the wasteland, and just like a strict father teaches the rules of life to his unruly kids by beating them, the Judges punish all who act against the Codex’s teachings. Punishment is not an end in itself, but a tool to frighten the masses and lead them on the path to purity, so the First Judge writes in his journal.</span></p>\n<br />Thus, the Judges have developed many forms of reproof, castigation, and harsh punishments for every crime during the long years of their existence. They know no imprisonment, though. Justitian was not willing to shoulder the cost for arresting and feeding a prisoner for days or even months. <br /><br />The Judges’ penal system also needs to take into account that the people in the Protectorate are practically anonymous. No one has ever heard of passports or birth certificates. If you move house within Justitian, you can start a new life as a stranger in the new neighborhood. The Judges counteracted this by making punishments visible. For example, a thief’s hands and forearms are dyed blue using a stinking solution. The same color is used to mark the lips of liars and frauds. Depending on the mixture, this color takes weeks or months to fade. The culprits then get rid of the social anathema and get a second chance. Repeat offenders who are still marked are treated more harshly by the Judges and soon feel the iron fist of Justitian’s justice. Thieves have one knuckle on each hand smashed, frauds get their tongue split with a glowing blade. They should have taken the admonition to heart. <br /><br />Killers and rapists do not get a second chance. Their forehead is branded using a Judgment iron, and they are banned from the Protectorate. Should they return to be arrested, the Judges leave it to the victims or their relatives to choose the punishment. Popular forms of punishment are smashing a limb with the Judgment hammer or tearing it out using the Judge’s horse. In especially severe cases, there is a death sentence and the culprit is killed by a heavy blow to the head. <br /><br />Many culprits, especially those guilty of lesser crimes, get to choose. Either pay an indemnification to their victims or spend a few days in Justitian’s labour camps. Additionally, their faces are marked with red color, the henna. In the following days, they work for the city’s benefit, repair streets, build houses, shovel dirt from the Defiler Streets, fight the dust with their spades, and work on the great Colossus, Chairman Archot’s legacy. If one of them flees and gets caught, he must expect severe repercussions. If the Judges showed mercy, it would be considered weakness. That is something they cannot allow if they want to keep controlling their army of forced laborers. They will treat him like a felon. Only when the henna fades away after two or three weeks may the prisoner go unmolested. A few even stay. Two meals a day are more than they could manage in their normal lives. <br /><br />The Judges’ punishments shape Justitian’s culture. A deal is always sealed by a handshake, before which merchant and customer take off their gloves or wrappings, making sure that the other has no marked skin before getting down to business. Those who wear their gloves on a market in Justitian must expect to be eyed warily. “Show me your hands” is a familiar saying. The same is true for the face. It is considered impolite to hide your face under scarf or breathing mask while in conversation. Why would you do that if not to hide the fact that you are a liar or a fraud? Showing your face is considered tantamount to honesty. Thus, strangers who do not know Justitian’s ways often have a hard time getting started in the Protectorate.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>ADVOCATES: CODEX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>BOOK⏵</p>\n<p>TIMELINE⏵</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nThe drill in the dust, the shouting when fighting with the hammers and the eternal din from the Protectors’ sealing block – all this is a permanent nuisance to the Advocates.

At least, this is what the historians will write. Without using force, his Judges annexed dozens of the villages and erected their Judgement stones all over Borca. The Clans died in the hail of lead from the Judges’ muskets. The Cockroach Clan, savage and bestial as it was, crawled back between the crevices, never to be seen again. The smugglers’ nest called Ignatz was razed in a concerted punitive expedition together with the Preservists. The Judges advanced on all fronts, smashing and rebuilding. Archot himself knew of his magnificence and consciously hid under an insufficient layer of false humility.</span></p>\n<br />If the rumors in the Senate can be believed, Archot feared nothing more than to be forgotten after his death. According to tradition, a stone head would be erected for him next to the Judgement Alley – and thus, he would just be one of a long line of Supreme Judges. It is said he couldn’t stand this notion – and so, it began. He gathered his Advocates and issued a new edict. For his fire to inspire those who came after him, a mausoleum that did his achievements justice should be built for him. The prisoners in the boot camps had a new job. They struggled in the ruins, harvested stones, and dragged them to Justitian’s Uptown. They piled them up at the end of the Judgement Alley: layer by layer, a stone torso formed, passing from a sinewy neck to the chin, tapering at the shoulders. <br /><br />The Colossus towered 30 feet high when a Jehammedan assassin blew it up. <br /><br />More than just a pile of stones were destroyed that day: Archot’s soul crumbled. Someone had to pay. There were witnesses to the attack. A Chronicler Sensorium registered the Hagari shortly before the detonation. The overseers at the Colossus had also seen a female Jehammedan. Archot got word of these facts less than 30 minutes after the attack. He also knew that the Osmani had sent an Isaaki, one of their blessed children, to Justitian. Archot stood on the steps of the Hall of Judgement in his flowing robes, his white hair in disarray and his eyes dark with sadness and hard with fury. “Hang him!” <br /><br />Streamers spread out, trying to warn the Jehammedan community, but they did not reach them. Interface lag. In the end, Rutgar’s Black Judges found the Isaaki, Gideon, and riddled him with 12 rounds of lead. His horse carried him on for more than 50 steps before the corpse slid from the saddle and hit the pavement.<br /><br />Archot decided to hang the Isaaki on a jib a on the Uptown wall. Fodder for the crows and, of course, a sign of his disapproval. <br /><br />An era of strength ended, and Archot’s madness would define the next.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>RETREAT</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Jehammedan Quarter survived, mainly due to the Iconide Baruch who demanded the family council turn their backs on Osman.

Between them, two colossal bronze statues in Judges’ robes tower eight meters high: one is leaning on a hammer, the other presses a dusty image of the Codex to its chest.

The Hall of Judgement is rectangular, 80 m long and 50 m wide, a fortress with thick walls and pillars carrying the weight of the inner dome. High, arched windows with artistic glass paintings symbolizing the Judges’ virtues on one side and the outlaws’ deadly sins on the other break up the buildings angular form.

It is said they are better off than some of Justitian’s citizens. In the Hall of Judgement, actually consisting of several vaults, there is a sacral mood. The stained-glass windows break the light into a display of blue, red, and green colored panes. Judges and Chroniclers walk in and out of here all the time: the most important offices can be found in the south wing. The center opens up onto an atrium surrounded by a cloister. Here, Protectors and Advocates meet for friendly discussions. In the main hall, the Supreme Judge resides. In the adjoining side wings, the Senates meet.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE CODEX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">SERVE JUSTICE, </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">SEEK THAT WHICH IS WRONG, </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">THE WORD </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">GIVES US PREMONITION AND SHOWS US THE WAY. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT AWAKENS THE SPIRIT, </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">EXACTS THE CONSCIOUSNESS. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">T</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">HE HAMMER </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">DOES NOT SHOW THE WAY. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT PUNISHES. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT EXORCISES. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IT REMOVES. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">CLOAK AND HAT ARE THE SIGNS OF THE COMMUNITY OF THE RIGHTEOUS. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">THEY DEMAND HUMILITY </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">AND ASK FOR RESPECT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">GOGGLES AND SCARF </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ARE THE SHADOW </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">HIDING THE FEAR AND </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">DEFLECTING REVENGE. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">THE MUSKET </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">IS LIGHT AND LIGHTNING. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">ALL THAT IS FALSE FLEES FROM IT </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">INTO RUIN.<br /></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE BARRACKS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\"> </td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">At strategic points in Justitian, the Judges have erected barracks.

Anything that costs them time and energy without bringing any Dinars, they deny. That is why they never had any interest in a complete written history. But they have left their traces: in the Bank of Commerce and in private archives, ledgers and folders full of treaties and agreements gather dust. With some intuition and patience, it is possible to distill the Neolibyans’ history from them.</p>\n<p>It starts roughly 50 years after the devastation of the African coast. The first reports were found in the African outback and were penned by the Libyan. He was a merchant, a shrewd accountant and very enterprising. He catered for the survivors and thus wove the network of contacts that would support him until the end. His trading posts along the African Mediterranean coast were like seeds that soon sprouted into strong cities. One of them was Tripol: according to history the Libyan’s home village started amidst the ruins of ancient Tripoli. Here the streams of commerce met – at least that’s what the books say – and brought unexpected wealth not only to the Libyan: tea, expensive fabrics, oil in amphorae, sacks full of grain, and metalwork piled up in the warehouses and caverns. The ancestral spirits looked favorably upon the city. Tripol blossomed.</p>\n<p>The Libyan’s enterprises had grown too big to be controlled by him alone. The lists dating back to those days count hundreds of packers, helping hands, and scribes, some of them former competitors whom the Libyan had vanquished in wars of trade. Other cost items indicate that some of the profit was funneled back to the populace. The Libyan paid for the construction of meeting halls and had workers create fields or fortified canals. Africa’s decline had been stopped.</p>\n<p>Now, its inhabitants prepared to storm a mountain of inherited Cultural waste, Clan enmities, and desolate structures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE FOUNDATION</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵<br />@UUID[Compendium.the-stream.timeline.6j15f1Nl0YjS6WgD.JournalEntryPage.OwNfUSBFi6ZpO0Un#2215-━-the-cult-of-the-neolibyans]{2215}</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Libyan hated every word that did not directly lead to a profit measured in Dinars.

The first reports were found in the African outback and were penned by the Libyan. He was a merchant, a shrewd accountant and very enterprising. He catered for the survivors and thus wove the network of contacts that would support him until the end. His trading posts along the African Mediterranean coast were like seeds that soon sprouted into strong cities. One of them was Tripol: according to history the Libyan’s home village started amidst the ruins of ancient Tripoli. Here the streams of commerce met – at least that’s what the books say – and brought unexpected wealth not only to the Libyan: tea, expensive fabrics, oil in amphorae, sacks full of grain, and metalwork piled up in the warehouses and caverns. The ancestral spirits looked favorably upon the city. Tripol blossomed.</p>\n<p>The Libyan’s enterprises had grown too big to be controlled by him alone. The lists dating back to those days count hundreds of packers, helping hands, and scribes, some of them former competitors whom the Libyan had vanquished in wars of trade. Other cost items indicate that some of the profit was funneled back to the populace. The Libyan paid for the construction of meeting halls and had workers create fields or fortified canals.

With their towering merchant ships belching smoke, they bring Scourgers and Scrappers to the Frankan and Purgan coasts, rumbling to shore with their Surge Tanks to get to work on pristine scrap fields.

The first reports were found in the African outback and were penned by the Libyan. He was a merchant, a shrewd accountant and very enterprising. He catered for the survivors and thus wove the network of contacts that would support him until the end. His trading posts along the African Mediterranean coast were like seeds that soon sprouted into strong cities. One of them was Tripol: according to history the Libyan’s home village started amidst the ruins of ancient Tripoli. Here the streams of commerce met – at least that’s what the books say – and brought unexpected wealth not only to the Libyan: tea, expensive fabrics, oil in amphorae, sacks full of grain, and metalwork piled up in the warehouses and caverns. The ancestral spirits looked favorably upon the city. Tripol blossomed.</p>\n<p>The Libyan’s enterprises had grown too big to be controlled by him alone.

Hundreds of thousands streamed into the Recombination Group’s subterranean facilities all over the world under cover of night. They gazed straight ahead, there was no doubt in their eyes. They were beautiful people: strong and powerfully built, their skin without blemish. Everyone knew them as the “Guardians”. With long strides, they went down into the mountain, through whitewashed, brightly lit corridors. They followed the signs, endless colorful lines. They went past operation theaters and ignored the generator rooms, the provisionary systems, and a forest of Freon tanks.</p>\n<p>They marched on.</p>\n<p>A hall opened up before them: thousands of tubes, all larger than a man, some standing, others lying on the floor or piled upon each other. Red and green lights flickered in turn, cables and hoses from the cylinders disappearing into the ceiling.</p>\n<p>The Guardians spread out and attacked the cylinders. They touched control panels, removed digital barriers. Inside, something hissed, and then the tops opened. Icecold mist from the inside drifted across the floor. Men, women, and children lay silently in the cylinders. They slept. Hoarfrost glittered on their skin. The lids were tight over the frozen eyes, and their cheeks sunken in. They were all ill, most of them frozen in the throes of death, awaiting a treatment that never came.</p>\n<p>The Guardians could have woken them. But what should they have answered to the questions and the screaming, the nervous “Am I healed?” or “What are you doing to me?” It would have added unacceptability to unpostponability.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Guardians put on gloves and took the bodies from the chambers. Bones and flesh cracked like ice. With scrapers, they removed the remainders, cleaning the cold chambers. They threw complete bodies as well as single arms and legs into carts, piling them up in a wild mix of limbs. Electro cars came, and cart after cart was hooked to them until they finally started moving with a hum.</p>\n<p>They drove to the storage halls. Endless halls with pillars, empty, the end barely visible to the naked eye. The electro cars unhinged the carts and returned. They carried everything here that the sleeping chambers had to offer.</p>\n<p>The work was done. One Guardian stood at the entrance and let his gaze drift across the army of carts. There had to be more than a hundred, all filled with what looked like a butcher’s leftovers. He switched off the light, closed the doors, locked and sealed the halls for eternity. No one noticed that some of those trapped inside awoke – this transgression remained unpunished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>SEALED</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Guardians formed an honor guard when their wards arrived in armored cars and climbed down into the Dispensers.

They had numbers on their wrists, all multiples of 100: there were 100s and 200s and 300s – up to the 900s. People in white coats were already waiting at the glass cylinders and hailed the newcomers. With a machine the size of their hand they scanned the tattoos, nodding. Everyone was tense, that feeling of being part of something big was ubiquitous. They were in a festive mood, like at one of Getrell’s announcements. But today, the gift was not self-awareness but survival.</p>\n<p>Ten days later, the newcomers had become Sleepers. Locked in the chambers, their eyes gazed out of crystalline nanite meshes. Shining green displays confirmed the cryostasis. Then the lights went out, the doors closed. Heavy steel bulkheads snapped into their bracings. The countdown had begun. 100 years until the first ejection.</p>\n<p>The Guardians lived on the outer ring. They maintained the backup systems and bioreactors, watched the data stream from the facility’s core: the Sleeper Chambers. This data stream really was something. Those who tried to find a pattern in the flood of gene and human parameters soon were successful. Too soon, some of the Guardians thought, but their warnings remained unheard. All the Sleepers carried within them a special combination of genes that made them… divine? According to data, there was no other possible conclusion.</p>\n<p>It was all a facade.

Seeing became less important, other senses like hearing and touch took over leadership from the eyes. When the darkness threatened to swallow them completely, the Guardians scratched their collective knowledge into the walls. With fingers caressing the scratches, one could experience the last days of light, learn about the Sleepers’ powers, or listen to problems and fears of Guardians who had lived many years ago. A history in stone. Next, the intercoms died. The Guardians replaced them with a tube system that wound through the bunker in endless curves.

The bioreactors leaked and spilled organic matter throughout the corridors, cable insulations became brittle and cracked, displays flashed for one last time and then blacked out. The technology in the bunker facilities was slowly wearing itself down, and there was nothing that the Guardians could do about it.

A Paler with a deep, resonant voice is more influential than one who speaks in a falsetto. Children with a strong vocal power were made to train their pronunciation.

His memetics develop along with his nature: Rato, a Demagogue of fear, controls his subordinates through terror and punishes deviance with panic, the words of Chire, a Demagogue of violence, hurt like whip lashes, and Jiklas’ people indulge in the intoxication of song to forget the terrors of the outside world. Within the Cult, these influences work very well as they were created specifically as tools to control the Cult. But the abovegrounders also feel the fire in the vocal power of the Demagogues. It doesn’t burn their very soul like it does to the Palers, but it bends and twists something deep inside them: implanting fear even if the voice itself sounds very soft and sweet, luring them into a trap, hurting like hell, making gums bleed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AWAKENED</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>There had to be others like them out there, that threw themselves against the portals with broken hydraulic coils.

In the Dispensers they were considered heroes, their names were honored and meritorious Palers carried their names as honorary titles, but no one wanted to follow in their footsteps. Several years ago, a drawing surfaced. It showed a type of Dispenser that no Paler had ever seen. ‘Gusev’, number 12 of 44. According to the Chroniclers, the coordinates pointed to a location in Noret, right in the middle of the Machine Mens’ territory. But who trusts a Chronicler? At least in this case, the Palers did. Since then, the Revivers have been on the road again. They look for old records, dig into Recombination Group facilities, and exchange burnt-out artifacts for information. Sometimes they even talk to abovegrounders. Then, they hold back, ask instead of order. It doesn’t always work, but without help, they will not find the 44 bunkers. Maybe that’s the divines’ last test. Yes, the liberation must be truly at hand!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>SLEEPER</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The ancestors of the Palers belonged to the best that the Recombination Group had to offer. All of them were loyal and thoroughly infected with Getrell’s memetics: they looked up to the leaders of the Recombination Group gleaming eyes. That was not enough for Getrell. Deep down in the abysses of the sealed catacombs, those he had chosen himself waited for their awakening. Are they scientists, the board, soldiers? The Dispenser data systems bore witness and could tell – thousands of glass eyes watched the long march into the depths. But their life elixir ran out centuries ago. Without electricity, they have fallen silent. Posterity only has the words of Jaquar, an alleged Sleeper. In the ruins of Laibach, he was found by Hellvetics and told a story about betrayal, immortality, and madness: “Do you see this 100 here? Goes all the way down to the bone. Even right into the damn soul. Don’t touch it! I am, no, I was a Sociocybernetic. Others built roads, but I programmed groups of people. Advanced memetics. What year is this? No. That can’t be. That can’t be! Only weeks ago… I met a 300. That shouldn’t have happened.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">He spoke about Exalt: all the blood and gore, the endless labyrinths and the Grindworks. He said the city was their temple, prepared for a coming that would test and take in the best of us and to turn down the worst. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">But why? He told of the Free Spirit equipment. “Free Spirit – is that a rank or a subgroup? Why don’t we know it? Why do we know so little? There must be Dispensers, that have to still be in working order. The plan can still work…” It was to be his legacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Shortly afterward, Jaquar died under mysterious circumstances in a locked chamber in the Alpine Fortress. When the Hellvetics prepared the body for the last journey, they saw the countless pinpricks for the first time – as if something had milked him for his blood.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>TRADE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The implanted memes strengthen the community, but they also erect a barrier against everything from the outside.

Hundreds of thousands streamed into the Recombination Group’s subterranean facilities all over the world under cover of night. They gazed straight ahead, there was no doubt in their eyes. They were beautiful people: strong and powerfully built, their skin without blemish. Everyone knew them as the “Guardians”. With long strides, they went down into the mountain, through whitewashed, brightly lit corridors. They followed the signs, endless colorful lines. They went past operation theaters and ignored the generator rooms, the provisionary systems, and a forest of Freon tanks.</p>\n<p>They marched on.</p>\n<p>A hall opened up before them: thousands of tubes, all larger than a man, some standing, others lying on the floor or piled upon each other. Red and green lights flickered in turn, cables and hoses from the cylinders disappearing into the ceiling.</p>\n<p>The Guardians spread out and attacked the cylinders. They touched control panels, removed digital barriers. Inside, something hissed, and then the tops opened. Icecold mist from the inside drifted across the floor. Men, women, and children lay silently in the cylinders. They slept. Hoarfrost glittered on their skin. The lids were tight over the frozen eyes, and their cheeks sunken in. They were all ill, most of them frozen in the throes of death, awaiting a treatment that never came.</p>\n<p>The Guardians could have woken them. But what should they have answered to the questions and the screaming, the nervous “Am I healed?” or “What are you doing to me?” It would have added unacceptability to unpostponability.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Guardians put on gloves and took the bodies from the chambers. Bones and flesh cracked like ice. With scrapers, they removed the remainders, cleaning the cold chambers. They threw complete bodies as well as single arms and legs into carts, piling them up in a wild mix of limbs. Electro cars came, and cart after cart was hooked to them until they finally started moving with a hum.</p>\n<p>They drove to the storage halls. Endless halls with pillars, empty, the end barely visible to the naked eye. The electro cars unhinged the carts and returned. They carried everything here that the sleeping chambers had to offer.</p>\n<p>The work was done. One Guardian stood at the entrance and let his gaze drift across the army of carts. There had to be more than a hundred, all filled with what looked like a butcher’s leftovers. He switched off the light, closed the doors, locked and sealed the halls for eternity. No one noticed that some of those trapped inside awoke – this transgression remained unpunished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>SEALED</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Guardians formed an honor guard when their wards arrived in armored cars and climbed down into the Dispensers.

They had numbers on their wrists, all multiples of 100: there were 100s and 200s and 300s – up to the 900s. People in white coats were already waiting at the glass cylinders and hailed the newcomers. With a machine the size of their hand they scanned the tattoos, nodding. Everyone was tense, that feeling of being part of something big was ubiquitous. They were in a festive mood, like at one of Getrell’s announcements. But today, the gift was not self-awareness but survival.</p>\n<p>Ten days later, the newcomers had become Sleepers. Locked in the chambers, their eyes gazed out of crystalline nanite meshes. Shining green displays confirmed the cryostasis. Then the lights went out, the doors closed. Heavy steel bulkheads snapped into their bracings. The countdown had begun. 100 years until the first ejection.</p>\n<p>The Guardians lived on the outer ring. They maintained the backup systems and bioreactors, watched the data stream from the facility’s core: the Sleeper Chambers. This data stream really was something. Those who tried to find a pattern in the flood of gene and human parameters soon were successful. Too soon, some of the Guardians thought, but their warnings remained unheard. All the Sleepers carried within them a special combination of genes that made them… divine? According to data, there was no other possible conclusion.</p>\n<p>It was all a facade.

Seeing became less important, other senses like hearing and touch took over leadership from the eyes. When the darkness threatened to swallow them completely, the Guardians scratched their collective knowledge into the walls. With fingers caressing the scratches, one could experience the last days of light, learn about the Sleepers’ powers, or listen to problems and fears of Guardians who had lived many years ago. A history in stone. Next, the intercoms died. The Guardians replaced them with a tube system that wound through the bunker in endless curves.

The bioreactors leaked and spilled organic matter throughout the corridors, cable insulations became brittle and cracked, displays flashed for one last time and then blacked out. The technology in the bunker facilities was slowly wearing itself down, and there was nothing that the Guardians could do about it.

A Paler with a deep, resonant voice is more influential than one who speaks in a falsetto. Children with a strong vocal power were made to train their pronunciation.

His memetics develop along with his nature: Rato, a Demagogue of fear, controls his subordinates through terror and punishes deviance with panic, the words of Chire, a Demagogue of violence, hurt like whip lashes, and Jiklas’ people indulge in the intoxication of song to forget the terrors of the outside world. Within the Cult, these influences work very well as they were created specifically as tools to control the Cult. But the abovegrounders also feel the fire in the vocal power of the Demagogues. It doesn’t burn their very soul like it does to the Palers, but it bends and twists something deep inside them: implanting fear even if the voice itself sounds very soft and sweet, luring them into a trap, hurting like hell, making gums bleed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AWAKENED</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>There had to be others like them out there, that threw themselves against the portals with broken hydraulic coils.

They were on a holy quest and felt that they were getting closer to their goal with each and every Dispenser. Eventually, they had checked all of the Dispenser locations on the maps. The search was over. All Palers were free. Still, they felt incomplete. They had to have overlooked something.</p>\n<p>The Revivers settled down, grew old, and died in bitterness. In the Dispensers they were considered heroes, their names were honored and meritorious Palers carried their names as honorary titles, but no one wanted to follow in their footsteps. Several years ago, a drawing surfaced. It showed a type of Dispenser that no Paler had ever seen. ‘Gusev’, number 12 of 44. According to the Chroniclers, the coordinates pointed to a location in Noret, right in the middle of the Machine Mens’ territory. But who trusts a Chronicler? At least in this case, the Palers did. Since then, the Revivers have been on the road again. They look for old records, dig into Recombination Group facilities, and exchange burnt-out artifacts for information. Sometimes they even talk to abovegrounders. Then, they hold back, ask instead of order. It doesn’t always work, but without help, they will not find the 44 bunkers. Maybe that’s the divines’ last test. Yes, the liberation must be truly at hand!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>SLEEPER</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The ancestors of the Palers belonged to the best that the Recombination Group had to offer. All of them were loyal and thoroughly infected with Getrell’s memetics: they looked up to the leaders of the Recombination Group gleaming eyes. That was not enough for Getrell. Deep down in the abysses of the sealed catacombs, those he had chosen himself waited for their awakening. Are they scientists, the board, soldiers? The Dispenser data systems bore witness and could tell – thousands of glass eyes watched the long march into the depths. But their life elixir ran out centuries ago. Without electricity, they have fallen silent. Posterity only has the words of Jaquar, an alleged Sleeper. In the ruins of Laibach, he was found by Hellvetics and told a story about betrayal, immortality, and madness: “Do you see this 100 here? Goes all the way down to the bone. Even right into the damn soul. Don’t touch it! I am, no, I was a Sociocybernetic. Others built roads, but I programmed groups of people. Advanced memetics. What year is this? No. That can’t be. That can’t be! Only weeks ago… I met a 300. That shouldn’t have happened.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">He spoke about Exalt: all the blood and gore, the endless labyrinths and the Grindworks.

He told of the Free Spirit equipment. “Free Spirit – is that a rank or a subgroup? Why don’t we know it? Why do we know so little? There must be Dispensers, that have to still be in working order. The plan can still work…” It was to be his legacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Shortly afterward, Jaquar died under mysterious circumstances in a locked chamber in the Alpine Fortress. When the Hellvetics prepared the body for the last journey, they saw the countless pinpricks for the first time – as if something had milked him for his blood.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>TRADE</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The implanted memes strengthen the community, but they also erect a barrier against everything from the outside.

Soon, the tempest will wash away any dirt, and the roaring of the water will be the only sound in the jungle for many hours to come.</p>\n<p>Before us is another building. The painted plaster has fallen from the mud bricks in large areas. But the image of the dark figure with the great muscles and the angry look can still be easily seen due to its size.

The drawing next to it shows the dark figure – the African – gloating over the prone white man and grabbing his whip. There is one image after the other.</p>\n<p>The Scourge now cuts glowing lines into its former owner’s body.

They expect a lot of them: not only to defend the land, but also to safeguard its traditions against the ravages of time. Whenever an African is caught lying, has done some damage to another African, or even needs to move a rock to build his hut, the Scourgers are called in. The Scourgers decide in the spirit of the traditions, and they decide quickly. Liars may not speak until the good spirits of the village send a sign, those who have caused damage to others have to repair that damage, even if they must do so by their own hands’ work, the rock may only be moved if no one in the village opposes the idea and the spirit inhabiting the rock has been pacified with sacrifices for a whole month.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>WARUI</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Swahili, Arabic, Hausa, Malinke, Kikongo, Amharic, Somali, and thousands of other languages were spoken in Africa, some by populations of hundreds of millions, others by a few dozen people on the brink of extinction.

The people lost their fathers’ tongue and communicated on a rudimentary level with simple words, clicks, and other basic sounds. This new language formed images in the minds of its users, conveying a painful intensity of emotions with few phonemes. The Scourgers call it Warui, meaning “from the river”. They consider it the legacy of the eight ancestors who pierced the barrier by interfering with the human world and making way for a flood of emotions and ancient knowledge. Those who drink from this river are rid of the intellectual ballast of centuries, of grammar and vocabulary, and regain the first and most primordial of all languages in which the spirits and ancestors communicate with the Africans.</p>\n<p>Without the Warui, the Scourgers hailing from villages and cities all over Africa could never have joined together. In battle, it unites the warriors’ souls in a way that is far beyond human language.</p>\n<p>But in the cold north, the ancestors’ influence diminishes, and so does the strength of the Warui.

To deny him would mean offending the ancestors. However, there are limits to what a Scourger can demand. If he’s thought to be immoderate – hoarding riches or demanding gifts that he doesn’t need to do his job, for example – his brothers and sisters take care of him. Quickly, and without much ado.

When equipped with a cage on the bed, they are perfectly suited for hunting – humans or animals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Many Scourgers also train hyenas that can track enemies in areas where Koms cannot maneuver. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Just like at the Neolibyan’s table, a Scourger has to be modest in battle: a Hybrispanian village full of old people, women, and children will not be subjected to a softeningup barrage, but attacked with spears, a boar will not be killed from a distance, but attacked with a knife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> For the Scourgers, fighting means a battle between souls and a trial of strength.

There’s a tingle that runs through the body, the breath quickens, and gibberish floods the mind. They have accomplished something. They feel to the core of their being.</p>\n<p>Every ancestor plucks the string of life in his own special way, and every ancestor appears alone. The emotions he triggers jump from person to person and spread like a bubble. The people are carried by the wave: at the epicenter, the emotions smash the walls of reason and determine the people’s thoughts, emotions, and actions.</p>\n<p>A few hundred paces further out, the effects fade. The emotions sink to the subconscious. They guide without resulting in full turns. Days later, the influence fades completely or is replaced by other emotions, another ancestor.</p>\n<p>Scourgers and Anubians are especially sensitive to this. While Anubians lower their gaze in silent meditation, the Scourgers become inspired and exercise every aspect of the ancestor. They don’t know his name: the eight ancestors come from a time and sphere that has no room for words, only emotions and conflation as experienced today in the Warui or in dreams, nowhere else. To discuss these ancestors, one has to choose the roundabout way, talking about their aspects or using metaphors.</p>\n<p>The first ancestor is often characterized as an eagle. He soars above everything, broadening his gaze to the horizon of his own being, but also taking in his surroundings. He strengthens intuition and gives hints of the future.</p>\n<p>The second ancestor embodies the strength and superiority of the Lion. If this ancestor comes over a region, the people square their shoulders, compete with one another in duels, and take on any challenge.</p>\n<p>The third ancestor is like earth in one’s hand, like a wall crumbling to dust because of a thought, like an earthquake. He manifests in the form of creative energy and of physical and mental exhaustion. Under his influence, great works of art and giant buildings are created.</p>\n<p>The fourth ancestor opens people’s hearts. He is community and love. Joining on a spiritual level, he tears down barriers.</p>\n<p>The fifth ancestor is pure physical desire, colliding bodies that have only one goal: sexual reproduction. The sixth ancestor blows like a clear thought through the minds of the affected. The thousand layers of communication with their meta-meanings and lies crumble until only one layer remains. Every word is understood as intended. Every thought is a blazing star rising in the thinker’s mind.</p>\n<p>The seventh ancestor only appears where at least two ancestors’ influences collide. He superimposes them and unites their aspects. The Scourgers see him as the source of Warui.</p>\n<p>The eighth ancestor is the shadow cast by the other sevens’ light. He overwhelms and oppresses. His teeth and thorns catch every thought. People under his influence who may have been open-minded and friendly a moment ago suddenly act subversively and only for their own gain. But the Africans accept it without complaint. Their world has always been full of good and evil spirits: both are a part of the order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>UNTO DEATH</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nBeing a Scourger is not a birthright, but great deeds do not help a young African to become part of the warrior caste, either. It’s a mother’s sole decision: no amount of complaining will help if she thinks that a Neolibyan would be good for the family. Many a boy flees into the jungle looking for a Scourger pack willing to take him in. But no, if the child is not handed over by the mother herself, the warriors chase them away. <br /><br />Once a Scourger, he has to prove himself worthy at the age of 12. In the vicinity of Gibraltar, he will have to hunt down a freed slave. In Tripol, he will be abandoned in the jungle to confront wild animals, equipped only with a spear. The rites of acceptance vary from place to place, but they are all life-threatening. The applicant should not expect anyone to help. Even if a slave bashes his head in, the Scourgers will not interfere. Either the ancestors elect the child and lend their strength to the applicant, or not. If not, maybe they would’ve been better off as a Scrapper or Neolibyan after all. <br /><br />After this trial, the child is presented as a Scourger in his home village. Now he can draw on the Neolibyans. <br /><br />Between the age of 12 and 28, all Scourgers are cared for by their village’s community. These adolescents and adults may not marry: their deaths would cause existential problems for their partners. Of course, this does not stop them from having purely sexual relationships. <br /><br />After the age of 28 and a rite of passage, they swear to use their heads more and their fists less. They are now considered elders. They still fight, but now they act from the background and are now more responsible for planning missions. Older Scourgers may marry, but are fully liable for their partners and children. The Neolibyans are only obligated to take care of the warrior himself, not any of their hangers-on. The Scourger may still not work, though. Usually the profit from the selling of slaves to Neolibyan plantations guarantees suitable life with two to three partners for them. But they never get away from the fighting. <br /><br />At the age of about 50 – a foggy line, because many Scourgers stop counting the years once they become elders – they are considered sages. They lead their villages, passing judgment or entering a permanent liaison with their ancestors as shamans or hermits. Their numbers are few. The calmer years as an elder do not make up for the stressful life as a warrior. <br /><br />Not many reach the age of 45.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"CIWQZLE8LyfjkiH6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/cultcard_scourgers.png","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;height:120px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:71px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px;height:71px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>A white man’s warrior clan, guardians of Purgare and Southern Borca.

Soon, the tempest will wash away any dirt, and the roaring of the water will be the only sound in the jungle for many hours to come.</p>\n<p>Before us is another building. The painted plaster has fallen from the mud bricks in large areas. But the image of the dark figure with the great muscles and the angry look can still be easily seen due to its size.

The drawing next to it shows the dark figure – the African – gloating over the prone white man and grabbing his whip. There is one image after the other.</p>\n<p>The Scourge now cuts glowing lines into its former owner’s body.

They expect a lot of them: not only to defend the land, but also to safeguard its traditions against the ravages of time. Whenever an African is caught lying, has done some damage to another African, or even needs to move a rock to build his hut, the Scourgers are called in. The Scourgers decide in the spirit of the traditions, and they decide quickly. Liars may not speak until the good spirits of the village send a sign, those who have caused damage to others have to repair that damage, even if they must do so by their own hands’ work, the rock may only be moved if no one in the village opposes the idea and the spirit inhabiting the rock has been pacified with sacrifices for a whole month.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>WARUI</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Swahili, Arabic, Hausa, Malinke, Kikongo, Amharic, Somali, and thousands of other languages were spoken in Africa, some by populations of hundreds of millions, others by a few dozen people on the brink of extinction.

The people lost their fathers’ tongue and communicated on a rudimentary level with simple words, clicks, and other basic sounds. This new language formed images in the minds of its users, conveying a painful intensity of emotions with few phonemes. The Scourgers call it Warui, meaning “from the river”. They consider it the legacy of the eight ancestors who pierced the barrier by interfering with the human world and making way for a flood of emotions and ancient knowledge. Those who drink from this river are rid of the intellectual ballast of centuries, of grammar and vocabulary, and regain the first and most primordial of all languages in which the spirits and ancestors communicate with the Africans.</p>\n<p>Without the Warui, the Scourgers hailing from villages and cities all over Africa could never have joined together. In battle, it unites the warriors’ souls in a way that is far beyond human language.</p>\n<p>But in the cold north, the ancestors’ influence diminishes, and so does the strength of the Warui.

To deny him would mean offending the ancestors. However, there are limits to what a Scourger can demand. If he’s thought to be immoderate – hoarding riches or demanding gifts that he doesn’t need to do his job, for example – his brothers and sisters take care of him. Quickly, and without much ado.

When equipped with a cage on the bed, they are perfectly suited for hunting – humans or animals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Many Scourgers also train hyenas that can track enemies in areas where Koms cannot maneuver. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Just like at the Neolibyan’s table, a Scourger has to be modest in battle: a Hybrispanian village full of old people, women, and children will not be subjected to a softeningup barrage, but attacked with spears, a boar will not be killed from a distance, but attacked with a knife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> For the Scourgers, fighting means a battle between souls and a trial of strength.

There’s a tingle that runs through the body, the breath quickens, and gibberish floods the mind. They have accomplished something. They feel to the core of their being.</p>\n<p>Every ancestor plucks the string of life in his own special way, and every ancestor appears alone. The emotions he triggers jump from person to person and spread like a bubble. The people are carried by the wave: at the epicenter, the emotions smash the walls of reason and determine the people’s thoughts, emotions, and actions.</p>\n<p>A few hundred paces further out, the effects fade. The emotions sink to the subconscious. They guide without resulting in full turns. Days later, the influence fades completely or is replaced by other emotions, another ancestor.</p>\n<p>Scourgers and Anubians are especially sensitive to this. While Anubians lower their gaze in silent meditation, the Scourgers become inspired and exercise every aspect of the ancestor. They don’t know his name: the eight ancestors come from a time and sphere that has no room for words, only emotions and conflation as experienced today in the Warui or in dreams, nowhere else. To discuss these ancestors, one has to choose the roundabout way, talking about their aspects or using metaphors.</p>\n<p>The first ancestor is often characterized as an eagle. He soars above everything, broadening his gaze to the horizon of his own being, but also taking in his surroundings. He strengthens intuition and gives hints of the future.</p>\n<p>The second ancestor embodies the strength and superiority of the Lion. If this ancestor comes over a region, the people square their shoulders, compete with one another in duels, and take on any challenge.</p>\n<p>The third ancestor is like earth in one’s hand, like a wall crumbling to dust because of a thought, like an earthquake. He manifests in the form of creative energy and of physical and mental exhaustion. Under his influence, great works of art and giant buildings are created.</p>\n<p>The fourth ancestor opens people’s hearts. He is community and love. Joining on a spiritual level, he tears down barriers.</p>\n<p>The fifth ancestor is pure physical desire, colliding bodies that have only one goal: sexual reproduction. The sixth ancestor blows like a clear thought through the minds of the affected. The thousand layers of communication with their meta-meanings and lies crumble until only one layer remains. Every word is understood as intended. Every thought is a blazing star rising in the thinker’s mind.</p>\n<p>The seventh ancestor only appears where at least two ancestors’ influences collide. He superimposes them and unites their aspects. The Scourgers see him as the source of Warui.</p>\n<p>The eighth ancestor is the shadow cast by the other sevens’ light. He overwhelms and oppresses. His teeth and thorns catch every thought. People under his influence who may have been open-minded and friendly a moment ago suddenly act subversively and only for their own gain. But the Africans accept it without complaint. Their world has always been full of good and evil spirits: both are a part of the order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>UNTO DEATH</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nBeing a Scourger is not a birthright, but great deeds do not help a young African to become part of the warrior caste, either. It’s a mother’s sole decision: no amount of complaining will help if she thinks that a Neolibyan would be good for the family. Many a boy flees into the jungle looking for a Scourger pack willing to take him in. But no, if the child is not handed over by the mother herself, the warriors chase them away. <br /><br />Once a Scourger, he has to prove himself worthy at the age of 12. In the vicinity of Gibraltar, he will have to hunt down a freed slave. In Tripol, he will be abandoned in the jungle to confront wild animals, equipped only with a spear. The rites of acceptance vary from place to place, but they are all life-threatening. The applicant should not expect anyone to help. Even if a slave bashes his head in, the Scourgers will not interfere. Either the ancestors elect the child and lend their strength to the applicant, or not. If not, maybe they would’ve been better off as a Scrapper or Neolibyan after all. <br /><br />After this trial, the child is presented as a Scourger in his home village. Now he can draw on the Neolibyans. <br /><br />Between the age of 12 and 28, all Scourgers are cared for by their village’s community. These adolescents and adults may not marry: their deaths would cause existential problems for their partners. Of course, this does not stop them from having purely sexual relationships. <br /><br />After the age of 28 and a rite of passage, they swear to use their heads more and their fists less. They are now considered elders. They still fight, but now they act from the background and are now more responsible for planning missions. Older Scourgers may marry, but are fully liable for their partners and children. The Neolibyans are only obligated to take care of the warrior himself, not any of their hangers-on. The Scourger may still not work, though. Usually the profit from the selling of slaves to Neolibyan plantations guarantees suitable life with two to three partners for them. But they never get away from the fighting. <br /><br />At the age of about 50 – a foggy line, because many Scourgers stop counting the years once they become elders – they are considered sages. They lead their villages, passing judgment or entering a permanent liaison with their ancestors as shamans or hermits. Their numbers are few. The calmer years as an elder do not make up for the stressful life as a warrior. <br /><br />Not many reach the age of 45.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"HEADER","type":"image","_id":"CIWQZLE8LyfjkiH6","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":""},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"modules/the-stream/images/cultcard_scourgers.png","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;height:120px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:71px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px;height:71px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>A white man’s warrior clan, guardians of Purgare and Southern Borca.

Too often, that leads to greed.</p>\n<p>The Scrappers come in flocks to bring them their findings. Almost none of them really know what the artifacts are truly worth. It makes little to no sense to discuss this with the Chroniclers, for at the first sign of discussion or haggling they will suddenly lose interest, raise their pinky and rattle a brief “Exit! Exit!” from their Vocoders. The Scrappers have to take what they get. Supposedly they can get more whenever the Scrapper Cartel’s Appraisers are involved, but who knows for sure?</p>\n<p>Actually, the Chroniclers have made an art form out of evaluating an artifact: they examine it from all sides, plugging in diagnosis gear or using one of their crackling boxes on it. The artifact check can take an instant or minutes – but that has no effect on the price. As payment, the Scrappers get information on Bygone artifact stores (the Chroniclers call this “recursive information trade”) or Chronicler Drafts. The Scrappers accept, sometimes grudgingly, sometimes euphorically. It doesn’t matter to the Chroniclers, they’ll always return anyway.</p>\n<p>What the Chroniclers are to European Scrappers, the Neolibyans are to African ones. The Magnates’ Surge Tanks can hold tons of scrap: artifacts are cleaned and improved, metal is melted and cast into trusses and armor plates for new Surge Tanks.

In Europe, artifacts became objects of worship, but only the chosen ones were able to use and repair them. With every generation, more knowledge about electricity and mechanics disappeared.</p>\n<p>These were hard times for Scrappers, probably the hardest. Scrap doesn’t fill your belly. A steel rod a villager could use to support his hut or to bash in an attacker’s skull was worth more than one of the legendary thinking machines. However, the Europeans never gave up completely on the artifacts: the memory of the Bygones was supported by their gear, and where there was a will, there potentially was a way, too.</p>\n<p>The worship produced strange effects. Clans propagated stories of the relics’ inherent magic, accumulated scrap for their own tribes, and prayed to it – with negligible effects. Others banned the artifacts as a symbol of exaggerated materialism that must have driven any divinity from the Bygone people’s lives. Naturally, the two groups didn’t get along very well.</p>\n<p>The Scrappers were in the midst of it all, the piece of iron between anvil and hammer.</p>\n<p>However, better times were to come.</p>\n<p>In Borca, the Judges conjured a hail of lead and drove the sects from their Protectorate, while the Chroniclers built Alcoves and even showed interest in those platinum fragments that had been worn as jewelry on a necklace before. Suddenly, scrap was valuable again, and without all the dancing, screaming madmen in the wasteland, the risk became reasonable once more. The Scrappers set out.

They develop a feeling for the ruins, learn to interpret them. Who lived here once? How did they fare? And especially: did they survive the Eshaton and take their treasures with them? In a weird way, most Scrappers feel at home in the ruins. No unnecessary talk, no maneuvering, no misunderstandings caused by thoughtless compliments. Life is so simple out there. Sure, you have to watch out for the Gendos, and there isn’t always fresh water, and there’s little hope of good food, but even so, the ruins are a home to them that they won’t leave until their dying breath. A few deviate from this path of scavenging. They become Mechanists, creating true marvels from scrap: many legendary rifles, traps, and highly complex clockwork devices and locks have been built in their workshops. The Chroniclers are suspicious of this development. Suddenly, there is someone who has a use for the artifacts instead of trading them for a fistful of paper in the exchange Alcoves at once without second thought.

He rather crosses that path, dragging a sled with a pile of scrap, eyes cast down. Between the Scrappers, it’s the same: if you set out in groups, you are easier to find and have to share the haul. Still, they have developed a means of keeping in contact: the Scrapper runes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one would remember Grief who wandered the streets south of Tech-Central when the tunnel system still existed or Toktok who searched refugees’ mummies in mountain caves if both of them had not marked their way with runes. Their sign language is similar to a dog’s scent marks, pointing at dangers, events, and the user of the marks. Almost every Scrapper knows simple line symbols of his own design that can be easily scratched into walls with a knife. Many Scrappers have their name sign tattooed onto their forehead or the back of their hand as a mark of their individuality. Once they have searched a ruin, they mark it with a sign: “Was here. Walk on.” Other signs serve as waymarkers (arrows and triangles), danger signs (jagged lines), or point at watering holes (three horizontal lines). The meanings of the runes differ from region to region: there is no common alphabet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">African Scrappers do not know this way of communication.

They simply do not come back to the city at some point. <br /><br />All their life, they have brought artifacts to Chroniclers and dragged metal to Scrapper halls. Those who manage to get out find a new home in those Scrapper halls. Not necessarily a better one, because to dismantle scrap is hard work and quickly depletes an aging body. At least it is not far to the next bowl of root soup here. <br /><br />Those who have managed to become Mechanists or Manufacturers find a place amongst the rare communities of Scrappers.

It is not always clear if that is supposed to be a reward, common procedure, or a punishment. <br /><br />Social security among Scrappers is rather weak. Let the devil take the hindmost. In Africa, this is different, though: the Clan takes care of its old ones, showing them respect. Full of interest, the children bend closer to listen intently when the gnarled Scrappers talk about their adventures and battles against Borcan barbarians.

West Borca is a repository, bringing to the scene a whole army of Scrappers. Finding an untouched spot here borders on a miracle. Here, the Cartel, a community of Scrappers, has been flourishing for some years. Or rather that’s what Bosch, its leader, calls it with a wry smile. He is an irritable dwarf trying to leash the Black Lung’s Scrappers in order to extort higher prices from the Chroniclers. His bullies monitor the ruins and sell search licenses while his Appraisers offer their services to laden Scrappers in front of the exchange Alcoves – by force, if necessary. But his network has holes, and many Scrappers manage to bypass the Cartel.

Over there, the rules are different anyway. Nature takes back the seas of debris, and the superstitious nomads consider them cursed: they steer clear of the rugged rows of walls. In the last decades, some Scrappers from West Borca found their way into the wide conifer forests and settled there. Wherever they set foot, they dig artifacts from the forest floor. But the next Chroniclers are hundreds of days’ marches away – beyond a volcanically active fault that you can only circumvent via the Hellvetics’ fortress. This is no fun. Luckily, there are the renegade Needle Tower Chroniclers. The Cluster buzzes with agitation when anyone mentions them. Those who trade with the Needles are banned for life by the Chroniclers.

As payment, the Scrappers get information on Bygone artifact stores (the Chroniclers call this “recursive information trade”) or Chronicler Drafts. The Scrappers accept, sometimes grudgingly, sometimes euphorically. It doesn’t matter to the Chroniclers, they’ll always return anyway.</p>\n<p>What the Chroniclers are to European Scrappers, the Neolibyans are to African ones. The Magnates’ Surge Tanks can hold tons of scrap: artifacts are cleaned and improved, metal is melted and cast into trusses and armor plates for new Surge Tanks. But if you offer an amount of Chronicler Drafts that a Borcan would kill for to an African, he will spit at best. African Scrappers want to be paid in Dinars, minted by Tripol’s Bank of Commerce, heavy and shiny with gold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE CRAVING FOR THE PAST</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Centuries passed.

A steel rod a villager could use to support his hut or to bash in an attacker’s skull was worth more than one of the legendary thinking machines. However, the Europeans never gave up completely on the artifacts: the memory of the Bygones was supported by their gear, and where there was a will, there potentially was a way, too.</p>\n<p>The worship produced strange effects. Clans propagated stories of the relics’ inherent magic, accumulated scrap for their own tribes, and prayed to it – with negligible effects. Others banned the artifacts as a symbol of exaggerated materialism that must have driven any divinity from the Bygone people’s lives. Naturally, the two groups didn’t get along very well.</p>\n<p>The Scrappers were in the midst of it all, the piece of iron between anvil and hammer.</p>\n<p>However, better times were to come.</p>\n<p>In Borca, the Judges conjured a hail of lead and drove the sects from their Protectorate, while the Chroniclers built Alcoves and even showed interest in those platinum fragments that had been worn as jewelry on a necklace before. Suddenly, scrap was valuable again, and without all the dancing, screaming madmen in the wasteland, the risk became reasonable once more. The Scrappers set out.

Sure, you have to watch out for the Gendos, and there isn’t always fresh water, and there’s little hope of good food, but even so, the ruins are a home to them that they won’t leave until their dying breath. A few deviate from this path of scavenging. They become Mechanists, creating true marvels from scrap: many legendary rifles, traps, and highly complex clockwork devices and locks have been built in their workshops.

Almost every Scrapper knows simple line symbols of his own design that can be easily scratched into walls with a knife. Many Scrappers have their name sign tattooed onto their forehead or the back of their hand as a mark of their individuality. Once they have searched a ruin, they mark it with a sign: “Was here. Walk on.” Other signs serve as waymarkers (arrows and triangles), danger signs (jagged lines), or point at watering holes (three horizontal lines).

Too often, that leads to greed.</p>\n<p>The Scrappers come in flocks to bring them their findings. Almost none of them really know what the artifacts are truly worth. It makes little to no sense to discuss this with the Chroniclers, for at the first sign of discussion or haggling they will suddenly lose interest, raise their pinky and rattle a brief “Exit! Exit!” from their Vocoders. The Scrappers have to take what they get. Supposedly they can get more whenever the Scrapper Cartel’s Appraisers are involved, but who knows for sure?</p>\n<p>Actually, the Chroniclers have made an art form out of evaluating an artifact: they examine it from all sides, plugging in diagnosis gear or using one of their crackling boxes on it. The artifact check can take an instant or minutes – but that has no effect on the price. As payment, the Scrappers get information on Bygone artifact stores (the Chroniclers call this “recursive information trade”) or Chronicler Drafts. The Scrappers accept, sometimes grudgingly, sometimes euphorically. It doesn’t matter to the Chroniclers, they’ll always return anyway.</p>\n<p>What the Chroniclers are to European Scrappers, the Neolibyans are to African ones. The Magnates’ Surge Tanks can hold tons of scrap: artifacts are cleaned and improved, metal is melted and cast into trusses and armor plates for new Surge Tanks. But if you offer an amount of Chronicler Drafts that a Borcan would kill for to an African, he will spit at best.

With every generation, more knowledge about electricity and mechanics disappeared.</p>\n<p>These were hard times for Scrappers, probably the hardest. Scrap doesn’t fill your belly. A steel rod a villager could use to support his hut or to bash in an attacker’s skull was worth more than one of the legendary thinking machines. However, the Europeans never gave up completely on the artifacts: the memory of the Bygones was supported by their gear, and where there was a will, there potentially was a way, too.</p>\n<p>The worship produced strange effects. Clans propagated stories of the relics’ inherent magic, accumulated scrap for their own tribes, and prayed to it – with negligible effects. Others banned the artifacts as a symbol of exaggerated materialism that must have driven any divinity from the Bygone people’s lives. Naturally, the two groups didn’t get along very well.</p>\n<p>The Scrappers were in the midst of it all, the piece of iron between anvil and hammer.</p>\n<p>However, better times were to come.</p>\n<p>In Borca, the Judges conjured a hail of lead and drove the sects from their Protectorate, while the Chroniclers built Alcoves and even showed interest in those platinum fragments that had been worn as jewelry on a necklace before. Suddenly, scrap was valuable again, and without all the dancing, screaming madmen in the wasteland, the risk became reasonable once more. The Scrappers set out.

They develop a feeling for the ruins, learn to interpret them. Who lived here once? How did they fare? And especially: did they survive the Eshaton and take their treasures with them? In a weird way, most Scrappers feel at home in the ruins. No unnecessary talk, no maneuvering, no misunderstandings caused by thoughtless compliments. Life is so simple out there. Sure, you have to watch out for the Gendos, and there isn’t always fresh water, and there’s little hope of good food, but even so, the ruins are a home to them that they won’t leave until their dying breath. A few deviate from this path of scavenging. They become Mechanists, creating true marvels from scrap: many legendary rifles, traps, and highly complex clockwork devices and locks have been built in their workshops. The Chroniclers are suspicious of this development.

Almost every Scrapper knows simple line symbols of his own design that can be easily scratched into walls with a knife. Many Scrappers have their name sign tattooed onto their forehead or the back of their hand as a mark of their individuality. Once they have searched a ruin, they mark it with a sign: “Was here.

They simply do not come back to the city at some point. <br /><br />All their life, they have brought artifacts to Chroniclers and dragged metal to Scrapper halls. Those who manage to get out find a new home in those Scrapper halls. Not necessarily a better one, because to dismantle scrap is hard work and quickly depletes an aging body. At least it is not far to the next bowl of root soup here. <br /><br />Those who have managed to become Mechanists or Manufacturers find a place amongst the rare communities of Scrappers.

West Borca is a repository, bringing to the scene a whole army of Scrappers. Finding an untouched spot here borders on a miracle. Here, the Cartel, a community of Scrappers, has been flourishing for some years. Or rather that’s what Bosch, its leader, calls it with a wry smile. He is an irritable dwarf trying to leash the Black Lung’s Scrappers in order to extort higher prices from the Chroniclers. His bullies monitor the ruins and sell search licenses while his Appraisers offer their services to laden Scrappers in front of the exchange Alcoves – by force, if necessary. But his network has holes, and many Scrappers manage to bypass the Cartel. Even so, the organization is growing stronger by the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Beyond the Reaper’s Blow, Bosch’s influence fades. Over there, the rules are different anyway. Nature takes back the seas of debris, and the superstitious nomads consider them cursed: they steer clear of the rugged rows of walls. In the last decades, some Scrappers from West Borca found their way into the wide conifer forests and settled there. Wherever they set foot, they dig artifacts from the forest floor. But the next Chroniclers are hundreds of days’ marches away – beyond a volcanically active fault that you can only circumvent via the Hellvetics’ fortress. This is no fun. Luckily, there are the renegade Needle Tower Chroniclers. The Cluster buzzes with agitation when anyone mentions them. Those who trade with the Needles are banned for life by the Chroniclers. Of course, the Chroniclers don’t tell anybody how they find out who has dared to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Needle Towers aren’t the only ones who sometimes buy baubles.

Too often, that leads to greed.</p>\n<p>The Scrappers come in flocks to bring them their findings. Almost none of them really know what the artifacts are truly worth. It makes little to no sense to discuss this with the Chroniclers, for at the first sign of discussion or haggling they will suddenly lose interest, raise their pinky and rattle a brief “Exit! Exit!” from their Vocoders. The Scrappers have to take what they get. Supposedly they can get more whenever the Scrapper Cartel’s Appraisers are involved, but who knows for sure?</p>\n<p>Actually, the Chroniclers have made an art form out of evaluating an artifact: they examine it from all sides, plugging in diagnosis gear or using one of their crackling boxes on it. The artifact check can take an instant or minutes – but that has no effect on the price. As payment, the Scrappers get information on Bygone artifact stores (the Chroniclers call this “recursive information trade”) or Chronicler Drafts. The Scrappers accept, sometimes grudgingly, sometimes euphorically. It doesn’t matter to the Chroniclers, they’ll always return anyway.</p>\n<p>What the Chroniclers are to European Scrappers, the Neolibyans are to African ones. The Magnates’ Surge Tanks can hold tons of scrap: artifacts are cleaned and improved, metal is melted and cast into trusses and armor plates for new Surge Tanks.

In Europe, artifacts became objects of worship, but only the chosen ones were able to use and repair them. With every generation, more knowledge about electricity and mechanics disappeared.</p>\n<p>These were hard times for Scrappers, probably the hardest. Scrap doesn’t fill your belly. A steel rod a villager could use to support his hut or to bash in an attacker’s skull was worth more than one of the legendary thinking machines. However, the Europeans never gave up completely on the artifacts: the memory of the Bygones was supported by their gear, and where there was a will, there potentially was a way, too.</p>\n<p>The worship produced strange effects. Clans propagated stories of the relics’ inherent magic, accumulated scrap for their own tribes, and prayed to it – with negligible effects. Others banned the artifacts as a symbol of exaggerated materialism that must have driven any divinity from the Bygone people’s lives. Naturally, the two groups didn’t get along very well.</p>\n<p>The Scrappers were in the midst of it all, the piece of iron between anvil and hammer.</p>\n<p>However, better times were to come.</p>\n<p>In Borca, the Judges conjured a hail of lead and drove the sects from their Protectorate, while the Chroniclers built Alcoves and even showed interest in those platinum fragments that had been worn as jewelry on a necklace before. Suddenly, scrap was valuable again, and without all the dancing, screaming madmen in the wasteland, the risk became reasonable once more. The Scrappers set out.

They develop a feeling for the ruins, learn to interpret them. Who lived here once? How did they fare? And especially: did they survive the Eshaton and take their treasures with them? In a weird way, most Scrappers feel at home in the ruins. No unnecessary talk, no maneuvering, no misunderstandings caused by thoughtless compliments. Life is so simple out there. Sure, you have to watch out for the Gendos, and there isn’t always fresh water, and there’s little hope of good food, but even so, the ruins are a home to them that they won’t leave until their dying breath. A few deviate from this path of scavenging. They become Mechanists, creating true marvels from scrap: many legendary rifles, traps, and highly complex clockwork devices and locks have been built in their workshops. The Chroniclers are suspicious of this development. Suddenly, there is someone who has a use for the artifacts instead of trading them for a fistful of paper in the exchange Alcoves at once without second thought.

He rather crosses that path, dragging a sled with a pile of scrap, eyes cast down. Between the Scrappers, it’s the same: if you set out in groups, you are easier to find and have to share the haul. Still, they have developed a means of keeping in contact: the Scrapper runes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one would remember Grief who wandered the streets south of Tech-Central when the tunnel system still existed or Toktok who searched refugees’ mummies in mountain caves if both of them had not marked their way with runes. Their sign language is similar to a dog’s scent marks, pointing at dangers, events, and the user of the marks. Almost every Scrapper knows simple line symbols of his own design that can be easily scratched into walls with a knife. Many Scrappers have their name sign tattooed onto their forehead or the back of their hand as a mark of their individuality. Once they have searched a ruin, they mark it with a sign: “Was here. Walk on.” Other signs serve as waymarkers (arrows and triangles), danger signs (jagged lines), or point at watering holes (three horizontal lines). The meanings of the runes differ from region to region: there is no common alphabet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">African Scrappers do not know this way of communication.

They simply do not come back to the city at some point. <br /><br />All their life, they have brought artifacts to Chroniclers and dragged metal to Scrapper halls. Those who manage to get out find a new home in those Scrapper halls. Not necessarily a better one, because to dismantle scrap is hard work and quickly depletes an aging body. At least it is not far to the next bowl of root soup here. <br /><br />Those who have managed to become Mechanists or Manufacturers find a place amongst the rare communities of Scrappers.

It is not always clear if that is supposed to be a reward, common procedure, or a punishment. <br /><br />Social security among Scrappers is rather weak. Let the devil take the hindmost. In Africa, this is different, though: the Clan takes care of its old ones, showing them respect. Full of interest, the children bend closer to listen intently when the gnarled Scrappers talk about their adventures and battles against Borcan barbarians.

West Borca is a repository, bringing to the scene a whole army of Scrappers. Finding an untouched spot here borders on a miracle. Here, the Cartel, a community of Scrappers, has been flourishing for some years. Or rather that’s what Bosch, its leader, calls it with a wry smile. He is an irritable dwarf trying to leash the Black Lung’s Scrappers in order to extort higher prices from the Chroniclers. His bullies monitor the ruins and sell search licenses while his Appraisers offer their services to laden Scrappers in front of the exchange Alcoves – by force, if necessary. But his network has holes, and many Scrappers manage to bypass the Cartel.

Over there, the rules are different anyway. Nature takes back the seas of debris, and the superstitious nomads consider them cursed: they steer clear of the rugged rows of walls. In the last decades, some Scrappers from West Borca found their way into the wide conifer forests and settled there. Wherever they set foot, they dig artifacts from the forest floor. But the next Chroniclers are hundreds of days’ marches away – beyond a volcanically active fault that you can only circumvent via the Hellvetics’ fortress. This is no fun. Luckily, there are the renegade Needle Tower Chroniclers. The Cluster buzzes with agitation when anyone mentions them. Those who trade with the Needles are banned for life by the Chroniclers.

Were the people safe here?</p>\n<p>When the first cases from the Ruhr area were reported, the doctors fled behind the Spital walls. They barricaded the windows, closed the gates. Those waiting for recovery in the infirmaries were told via speakers to leave the region: “The Spital is closed, effective immediately. Go home.” From helplessness, a wave of anger arose, leading once again to violence. But HIVE was already rampant amongst the attackers, thinning out their ranks. Siege machinery and weapons fell from limp infected hands. The resistance was broken long before the battle was joined. Meanwhile, the doctors watched the events outside their walls from barred windows and high rooftops. Their eyes mirrored the despair of the diseased. Sympathy and sense of duty warred against self-preservation in their minds. Some doctors couldn’t stand it and jumped from the Spital’s roof.

It was directly related to the popular, cheap and potent drug called Burn. Side effects? Nothing that justified the Spitalians’ ban in the consumer’s eyes. The doctors lost ground, the strings on which the world danced to their tune were torn. Since 2221, strange mutations had occurred in Pollen, and now they ran rampant in Borca, too. Swarms of insects flooded the land, entering body cavities and stinging, biting, laying eggs. Spore fields blossomed everywhere, conquered one region after the other. In the east, Pollen and the Balkhan’s Mother spore fields united to form an impenetrable barrier and cut Europe off from Asia. The people still did not wake up: their minds were ravaged by the Burn intoxication.</p>\n<p>In 2300, the Spitalians rose against the Sepsis. They studied the Psychonauts and their Raptures, with new technologies like the Noumenon Vocalizer they sought out the Chakra collectives’ ether flickers and established the Primer theory.

The specially trained Hygienists watch this procedure, check the excrements, and report to their supervisors if anything should come up. The procedure is exhausting, but the Spitalians consider it redemption, a “de-fearing,” as it unties the knot of anxiety in their chest and certifies that they have the necessary purity.

The solution is enriched with epigenetic surrogates facilitating a spore infection and binding toxins to prevent decay. This brew needs several days to ripen, and then the doctors relocate the now infected muscles into glasses with fresh nutrient solution.

When Psychonauts or spore-afflicted people get close to such a container, the muscle cramps spasmodically. Time and again it beats against the glass hard: the dull knocking growing to a frenzied staccato as the Mollusk gets closer to the active spore source. The trembling tissue beats the liquid to a foaming froth until the final contact.</p>\n<p>However, the Mollusk only reacts to living beings that have opened the channel to an Earth Chakra through their spore infestation: spore laden Psychonauts, Burners on the drug, and carriers of the Seed.

The first step is easily taken, and he can soon call himself an Orderly. He is burdened with more responsibility that accompanies him until he starts studying medicine as a Famulancer. New perspectives arise: which departments is he interested in, what are his skills? While Famulancers walk the Spital’s chalked halls and discuss germ theory in an academic atmosphere with like-minded people, their honeymoon period is only brief. A Consultant forms a platoon to defend Danzig, and marching orders can reach anyone who hasn’t made himself indispensable elsewhere. The Famulancer goes to the Surgeons’ dissecting rooms, offers to clean the fermenters, helps at the Hygienist gates, cleans surgical instruments. Simple tasks one and all, but he shows interest and initiative – and makes himself useful. The clock stops, he does not have to fear conscription anymore, and a new life in the halls of the Surgeons, Epigeneticists, Pharmacists, Hygienists, Anaesthesiologists, Hippocrats, or general practitioners begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">So far, the Famulancer is only an afterthought in the department.

At the top of the department is its Representative, who deals out jobs and responsibilities. Only the Consultants stand above them – they shape the doctors’ ideology and specify their goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Registrar is the Consultants’ voice: he passes on orders to the departments and will become the next Consultant – if he survives that long. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">After 60 years of hard work in the service of the Spital, Spitalians are awarded the title of Elder: a genuflection before old age.

This branch exists outside the hierarchy. Those who discern themselves from the masses through an extreme mindset or extreme deeds (or rather: disqualifies himself from belonging to the masses) might be called to Arnsberg by Provost Kranzler himself. There, several years of training begin during which the aspirant’s mind is shattered and rebuilt as a mosaic according to Kranzler’s wishes. The Preservists’ job?

Their Recruits and Orderlies register every arrival, make a first diagnosis, name the price for the treatment, and put the diseased one in a bed according to their illness. The area is strictly divided into sick bays for the various diseases: the cholera quarter, the plague alley, the dysentery avenue, stretching into a ring around the Spital at the center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">In busy times, the Appendix is a city full of flickering life.

Other buildings are only charred concrete skeletons, cleansed of germs by fire bursts from Spitalian burners. Tents and huts made from metal scraps sprout in the many overcrowded quarters.

The Spitalians’ options in this area of longtime sickness are limited, and many who have traveled from afar die horribly while waiting for overburdened doctors who fight through streams of whimpering people day by day. There are nights when the wind comes from the southeast and one swears that the crying and moaning of the dying ones can be heard as far as Tech-Central in the center of Justitian, wailing like the distant screams of the damned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one in the Appendix can be sure not to end up like the dying man in the hut next door.

Spitalians stand guard on the battlements, staring grimly down into the Appendix with their Fungicide Rifles at the ready. The message is clear. No diseased person may pass the disinfection basins without authorization! <br /><br />Beyond the wall, there is the Corpus. This inner ring was once supposed to add warehouses, parking garages, labs and operating theatres to the Spital. The complex was never finished. Now, bunker foundations jut from the ground like dental necks. Pillars form concrete forests, steel trusses hint at roofs. The roads are channels cutting through this bunker world, their branches leading into the research groups’ labs and storage rooms via ramps. The main road from the gates to the central Spital is the Corpus’ lifeline. Everyone here knows his way around and walks it as unswervingly as an ant follows its queen’s pheromone trail. No stranger will ever have to keep his bearings in the Corpus. The few diseased who have bought better treatment are brought into the public hospitals by the gates at once where they stay until they’re cured, and they’d better not violate their house arrest as the security here is extremely tight. The Corpus is a dangerous place. In the high-security labs, the effects of diseases on animals are researched, and next to them, ramps lead down in the subterranean storage facilities for spore and plague victims. Almost no other place in the wasteland has the same potential to end all of mankind.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>SPITAL</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Spital itself resembles a fortress. An elongated concrete block with its cylindrical water and fungicide towers and other structures is expanded in several places by extensions belonging to various departments. The overhanging floors of the main bar throw shadows on the lower floors and darken the surrounding trench. A Spitalian who descends and stomps through the red dust encounters a hated part of Spital history. A lantern’s light falls upon iron plates and walled-off windows, scars mar walls that are fire-blackened over many meters. Someone once tried in vain to break through here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one has to go down there. Bridges span this chasm, which is more than five steps wide at the main entrances. Those who want to enter this hoard of infinite knowledge must have their urine tested for spore infestation by the Hygienists. A complete purification in the disinfection bath completes the check-up, cleanses the body and caresses the soul – we are pure inside and the dangers stay outside. The Spitalian takes a bag of shrink-wrapped clothing, tears it open, and puts on the white linen top and pants. His equipment will be cleaned and stored for him. Every Spitalian works towards the day when he may finally walk the chalk-white, brightly lit corridors. He will find a place amidst the libraries, reading rooms, labs and factories, amidst generators and fermenters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">If he joins a department, he moves to its wing. The Surgeons have several operating theatres, an auditorium, and the Panopticon, where they exhibit medical curios for their colleagues. Hopefully not just to shock new arrivals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Intensive care right next to the operating theatres is the domain of the Anaesthesiologists. Next to it is the general medical wing. Patients don’t have to go far from bed to surgery. Needing space, the Pharmacists use up a complete building block. It is home to the Community Pharmacy, where drugs are handed out, and several reading rooms and labs where fermenters and stills bubble and rustle day and night. Epigenetics stands as the most modern department, its wing fully electrified. The Hippocrats have taken over the second floor, monitoring compliance with statutes and ethical rules. From here, they can descend into every department without going through the lobby. They like it that way. The rest of the doctors don’t. The second floor is also home to the secret archives with dossiers on rogue doctors and the printing facilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Everything is in the Hippocrats’ hands. The Hygienists feel at home everywhere, but of course they also have their own wing with de-sporeing chambers as well as bodysuit maintenance. The sign above the entrance says “South Wing II”. Those who enter here will get to feel what the Hygienists think of cleanliness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Additional landmarks in the Spital are the registry, the public library, the garages, the prosthetics workshop, and the arsenal behind “Gate 6”. Here, the Spitalians can get weapons and expedition equipment, provided they have a warrant. Phosphor grenades and gas cartridges are built in the Pharmaceutics wing: for security reasons, chemical and biological weapons are not stored for more than 24 hours in the arsenal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Those who come across doors with the warning word “HIVE” sprayed upon them should simply keep walking. HIVE victims broke into the cellars centuries ago and died there. No one ever retrieved the bodies. To this day, no one knows if the HIVE survived in the bones, and no one wants to find out.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AT THE CENTER: COR</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:23.0569%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:76.9901%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Cor is the heart of the Spital, complete with forecourts (the disinfection gates), cardiac valves (Preservists guarding the doors), ventricles (labs and dorms) and sometimes ventricular fibrillation (the meetings of the board of Consultants). Actually, it’s rather two hearts, for there are several hundreds of meters of corridors between the Consultants’ chamber at the Ziggurat (a monolithic structure) and the block consisting of the research groups’ labs, private chambers, a power plant and experimental diagnosis centers equipped with electron-scanning microscopes and tomographers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Still the same is true for both areas: only those who are completely spore-free and can prove it may pass through the disinfection gates.

The result is a breed with high resistance to the Sepsis infestation, along with potent net and poison glands. The latter excrete a milkwhite liquid that is said to have properties similar to Vitamin C: it precludes decay and can be used to treat deficiency symptoms. Thousands of these Echein spiders were located in the Corpus’s subterranean caverns, but quickly spread across all of the Spital and attacked the vast insect population. Today, the doctors rarely find cockroaches or moths in the corridors. <br /><br />However, the task actually assigned to the arachnids is a completely different one: they spin cocoons around plague-ridden corpses and thus conserve them for later examinations. In the caverns, hundreds of cocoons are stuck to the walls. The energy consumption of a cold storage house to keep all these preserved fullbody specimens would be far beyond even the Spital’s capacities. <br /><br />These days, there must be millions of Echein spiders. These spiders’ huge nets are said to already have been seen in the ruins close to Justitian.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"core.JournalTextTinyMCESheet","sourceId":"JournalEntry.TJFp9QbiTIVh2K7S.JournalEntryPage.JwajVUcb5nCBFUe8"}}},{"sort":450000,"name":"STEREOTYPES","type":"text","_id":"z92dkMmcR6UU4tfO","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table style=\"width:94.8399%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col><col style=\"width:33%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;padding:6px\">\n<h3>ANABAPTISTS</h3>\n<p>Though we share common goals, they are full of misconceptions.

Those waiting for recovery in the infirmaries were told via speakers to leave the region: “The Spital is closed, effective immediately. Go home.” From helplessness, a wave of anger arose, leading once again to violence. But HIVE was already rampant amongst the attackers, thinning out their ranks. Siege machinery and weapons fell from limp infected hands. The resistance was broken long before the battle was joined. Meanwhile, the doctors watched the events outside their walls from barred windows and high rooftops. Their eyes mirrored the despair of the diseased. Sympathy and sense of duty warred against self-preservation in their minds. Some doctors couldn’t stand it and jumped from the Spital’s roof.

The doctors lost ground, the strings on which the world danced to their tune were torn. Since 2221, strange mutations had occurred in Pollen, and now they ran rampant in Borca, too. Swarms of insects flooded the land, entering body cavities and stinging, biting, laying eggs. Spore fields blossomed everywhere, conquered one region after the other.

The specially trained Hygienists watch this procedure, check the excrements, and report to their supervisors if anything should come up. The procedure is exhausting, but the Spitalians consider it redemption, a “de-fearing,” as it unties the knot of anxiety in their chest and certifies that they have the necessary purity.

The solution is enriched with epigenetic surrogates facilitating a spore infection and binding toxins to prevent decay. This brew needs several days to ripen, and then the doctors relocate the now infected muscles into glasses with fresh nutrient solution. They pull a membrane across the opening, allowing them to inject fresh nutrient solution and so-called gauging substances later.</p>\n<p>Those who are not in the know do not recognize that the cramped mass floating lazily in the water – that is called a “Mollusk” because of its appearance being similar to a snail’s - is much more than some bizarre trinket. When Psychonauts or spore-afflicted people get close to such a container, the muscle cramps spasmodically. Time and again it beats against the glass hard: the dull knocking growing to a frenzied staccato as the Mollusk gets closer to the active spore source. The trembling tissue beats the liquid to a foaming froth until the final contact.</p>\n<p>However, the Mollusk only reacts to living beings that have opened the channel to an Earth Chakra through their spore infestation: spore laden Psychonauts, Burners on the drug, and carriers of the Seed.

Whether you’re the scion of a meritorious Surgeon or had to watch your family being taken away by body carts from a dirty bed in the Appendix while an Orderly took care of you: all Spitalians start their career in the Appendix’s lingering illnesses as equals, with no shortcuts or perks granted due to their pedigree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As a Recruit, the young Spitalian collects experience and learns to accept the ichor-suffused reality. The first step is easily taken, and he can soon call himself an Orderly. He is burdened with more responsibility that accompanies him until he starts studying medicine as a Famulancer. New perspectives arise: which departments is he interested in, what are his skills? While Famulancers walk the Spital’s chalked halls and discuss germ theory in an academic atmosphere with like-minded people, their honeymoon period is only brief. A Consultant forms a platoon to defend Danzig, and marching orders can reach anyone who hasn’t made himself indispensable elsewhere. The Famulancer goes to the Surgeons’ dissecting rooms, offers to clean the fermenters, helps at the Hygienist gates, cleans surgical instruments. Simple tasks one and all, but he shows interest and initiative – and makes himself useful. The clock stops, he does not have to fear conscription anymore, and a new life in the halls of the Surgeons, Epigeneticists, Pharmacists, Hygienists, Anaesthesiologists, Hippocrats, or general practitioners begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">So far, the Famulancer is only an afterthought in the department. Years later, he will prove his worth to the department’s representative: a passed exam strengthens his position and allows him to bear his department’s title. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">From now on, the rungs of the career ladder are few, fragile and far apart. At the top of the department is its Representative, who deals out jobs and responsibilities. Only the Consultants stand above them – they shape the doctors’ ideology and specify their goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Registrar is the Consultants’ voice: he passes on orders to the departments and will become the next Consultant – if he survives that long. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">After 60 years of hard work in the service of the Spital, Spitalians are awarded the title of Elder: a genuflection before old age. They can pass on responsibilities to proxies, they meet and debate. Only they are allowed to openly criticize the Consultants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Finally, the Preservists. This branch exists outside the hierarchy. Those who discern themselves from the masses through an extreme mindset or extreme deeds (or rather: disqualifies himself from belonging to the masses) might be called to Arnsberg by Provost Kranzler himself. There, several years of training begin during which the aspirant’s mind is shattered and rebuilt as a mosaic according to Kranzler’s wishes. The Preservists’ job? To defend the Spital and humanity – and to do things that would be just too much for a common Surgeon.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>THE SPITAL</h2>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE OUTER RING: APPENDIX</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Summer drives the cold from the tundra. The soil thaws, blue and red blossoms explode in to cool teal. People step from their huts, stretching towards the sun and getting rid of their furs. The land awakens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">For the pathogens, a new year has begun. The warmth tickles bacteria from their hibernation, cesspits spew dysentery, cholera, and typhus into the villages. Lice and ticks burst from their eggs to ambush humans – carrying spirochetes, hepatic viruses and yersinia pestis. Death’s arsenal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Spitalians have long since ridden out to disinfect septic tanks and open bodies of water, and to vaccinate the citizens of Justitian. Still, they cannot completely suppress the epidemics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Every year, a stream of diseases pushes through the Black Lungs’ city canyons towards the Spital. The access roads have been freed from wreckage and old cars by healed people as a means to give thanks. Stone altars along the way speak of the healed people’s thankfulness. Colorful ribbons flutter on poles, wreaths made of weeds and animal sacrifices lie half-buried in the dust. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one can say for sure where exactly the change from the ruin field into the outer sick bays begins, nor when this transition is complete. Suddenly, a newcomer stands amidst wheezing, rag-clad figures, passes tents, and smells vomit and antiseptics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Spitalians coldly call this area “the Appendix,” an unloved appendage. Their Recruits and Orderlies register every arrival, make a first diagnosis, name the price for the treatment, and put the diseased one in a bed according to their illness. The area is strictly divided into sick bays for the various diseases: the cholera quarter, the plague alley, the dysentery avenue, stretching into a ring around the Spital at the center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">In busy times, the Appendix is a city full of flickering life. In times of helplessness, it’s a necropolis stinking of decay. Some of the dark, towering buildings are labeled with warning signs crudely painted with red paint and broad brushes that cover the building’s entire facade. Other buildings are only charred concrete skeletons, cleansed of germs by fire bursts from Spitalian burners. Tents and huts made from metal scraps sprout in the many overcrowded quarters. No one dares leaving their assigned area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">As bizarre as it may seem, among all the ragged, mucusspitting and slowly dying people, there is a normal kind of life in this city of the damned. Families stay with their diseased members, fulfilling menial tasks, beggars press themselves against the walls of houses and ask for food and water, merchants covering their mouths and noses with wet rags offer processed fruit, tubers, and lichen at inflated prices. The Spitalians’ options in this area of longtime sickness are limited, and many who have traveled from afar die horribly while waiting for overburdened doctors who fight through streams of whimpering people day by day. There are nights when the wind comes from the southeast and one swears that the crying and moaning of the dying ones can be heard as far as Tech-Central in the center of Justitian, wailing like the distant screams of the damned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one in the Appendix can be sure not to end up like the dying man in the hut next door. Only goods or Drafts heighten the chance of survival, for with them you can buy passage through the fortified gates to the Corpus.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>THE INNER RING: CORPUS</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:19.9602%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:80.0904%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p> </p>\nIn the middle of the Appendix, there is a wall of interlaced concrete elements. In many places, it has been expanded and extended by unfinished high-rise bunkers. Spitalians stand guard on the battlements, staring grimly down into the Appendix with their Fungicide Rifles at the ready. The message is clear. No diseased person may pass the disinfection basins without authorization! <br /><br />Beyond the wall, there is the Corpus. This inner ring was once supposed to add warehouses, parking garages, labs and operating theatres to the Spital. The complex was never finished. Now, bunker foundations jut from the ground like dental necks. Pillars form concrete forests, steel trusses hint at roofs. The roads are channels cutting through this bunker world, their branches leading into the research groups’ labs and storage rooms via ramps. The main road from the gates to the central Spital is the Corpus’ lifeline. Everyone here knows his way around and walks it as unswervingly as an ant follows its queen’s pheromone trail. No stranger will ever have to keep his bearings in the Corpus. The few diseased who have bought better treatment are brought into the public hospitals by the gates at once where they stay until they’re cured, and they’d better not violate their house arrest as the security here is extremely tight. The Corpus is a dangerous place. In the high-security labs, the effects of diseases on animals are researched, and next to them, ramps lead down in the subterranean storage facilities for spore and plague victims. Almost no other place in the wasteland has the same potential to end all of mankind.</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>SPITAL</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:20%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:99.383%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Spital itself resembles a fortress. An elongated concrete block with its cylindrical water and fungicide towers and other structures is expanded in several places by extensions belonging to various departments. The overhanging floors of the main bar throw shadows on the lower floors and darken the surrounding trench. A Spitalian who descends and stomps through the red dust encounters a hated part of Spital history. A lantern’s light falls upon iron plates and walled-off windows, scars mar walls that are fire-blackened over many meters. Someone once tried in vain to break through here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">No one has to go down there. Bridges span this chasm, which is more than five steps wide at the main entrances. Those who want to enter this hoard of infinite knowledge must have their urine tested for spore infestation by the Hygienists. A complete purification in the disinfection bath completes the check-up, cleanses the body and caresses the soul – we are pure inside and the dangers stay outside. The Spitalian takes a bag of shrink-wrapped clothing, tears it open, and puts on the white linen top and pants. His equipment will be cleaned and stored for him. Every Spitalian works towards the day when he may finally walk the chalk-white, brightly lit corridors. He will find a place amidst the libraries, reading rooms, labs and factories, amidst generators and fermenters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">If he joins a department, he moves to its wing. The Surgeons have several operating theatres, an auditorium, and the Panopticon, where they exhibit medical curios for their colleagues. Hopefully not just to shock new arrivals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Intensive care right next to the operating theatres is the domain of the Anaesthesiologists. Next to it is the general medical wing. Patients don’t have to go far from bed to surgery. Needing space, the Pharmacists use up a complete building block. It is home to the Community Pharmacy, where drugs are handed out, and several reading rooms and labs where fermenters and stills bubble and rustle day and night. Epigenetics stands as the most modern department, its wing fully electrified. The Hippocrats have taken over the second floor, monitoring compliance with statutes and ethical rules. From here, they can descend into every department without going through the lobby. They like it that way. The rest of the doctors don’t. The second floor is also home to the secret archives with dossiers on rogue doctors and the printing facilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Everything is in the Hippocrats’ hands. The Hygienists feel at home everywhere, but of course they also have their own wing with de-sporeing chambers as well as bodysuit maintenance. The sign above the entrance says “South Wing II”. Those who enter here will get to feel what the Hygienists think of cleanliness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Additional landmarks in the Spital are the registry, the public library, the garages, the prosthetics workshop, and the arsenal behind “Gate 6”. Here, the Spitalians can get weapons and expedition equipment, provided they have a warrant. Phosphor grenades and gas cartridges are built in the Pharmaceutics wing: for security reasons, chemical and biological weapons are not stored for more than 24 hours in the arsenal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Those who come across doors with the warning word “HIVE” sprayed upon them should simply keep walking. HIVE victims broke into the cellars centuries ago and died there. No one ever retrieved the bodies. To this day, no one knows if the HIVE survived in the bones, and no one wants to find out.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</blockquote>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:95%;border-width:1px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px\">\n<h3>AT THE CENTER: COR</h3>\n<table style=\"height:17px;width:95.1526%;border-width:1px;border-style:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;vertical-align:top;width:23.0569%;border-style:hidden\">\n<p>REFERENCE⏵Link</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-width:1px;height:17px;width:76.9901%;border-style:hidden;vertical-align:top\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Cor is the heart of the Spital, complete with forecourts (the disinfection gates), cardiac valves (Preservists guarding the doors), ventricles (labs and dorms) and sometimes ventricular fibrillation (the meetings of the board of Consultants).

The latter excrete a milkwhite liquid that is said to have properties similar to Vitamin C: it precludes decay and can be used to treat deficiency symptoms. Thousands of these Echein spiders were located in the Corpus’s subterranean caverns, but quickly spread across all of the Spital and attacked the vast insect population. Today, the doctors rarely find cockroaches or moths in the corridors. <br /><br />However, the task actually assigned to the arachnids is a completely different one: they spin cocoons around plague-ridden corpses and thus conserve them for later examinations. In the caverns, hundreds of cocoons are stuck to the walls. The energy consumption of a cold storage house to keep all these preserved fullbody specimens would be far beyond even the Spital’s capacities. <br /><br />These days, there must be millions of Echein spiders.
